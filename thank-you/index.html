    Our work would not be possible without the support of
              dedicated donors and volunteers. We truly appreciate
              your time and generosity. While there are too many
              groups and individuals to capture them all here, we
              would especially like to thank the following:

    Foundry United Methodist generously provides free
              space for BtP to house donated books and to fill
              prisoners' requests. In addition, Foundry's
              missions program helps support BtP by assisting in
              fundraisers and providing volunteers.

    We sometimes receive large-volume book donations that won't
              immediately fit in our room at Foundry, and are very grateful to
              be able to store them nearby in space provided by MakeOffices at
              Penn Ave.

    Library Friends groups from across the region regularly donate
              books in our most-needed
              categories, including paperback dictionaries, how-to-draw books,
              westerns, and fantasy novels.

    We are grateful to many other groups and individuals
              who have contributed labor, books, and/or postage
              money. We are grateful for every contribution,
              whether it's a single dictionary or a truckload of
              books, a sheet of postage stamps or a $1000 check, a
              one-time contribution or a weekly commitment.
              Together, these contributions allow BtP to serve
              thousands of prisoners and change lives.
