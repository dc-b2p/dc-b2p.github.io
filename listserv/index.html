    If you are interested in Books to Prisons, please
              consider joining one of our listserves. We have two,
              one for folks who are around a lot and want a
              high-traffic email list to discuss the day to day
              operations of Books to Prisons, and one to get
              announcements out to folks who want to know what we
              are up to. Please read the descriptions below, and
              decide which listserve is right for you.

    <strong>
     The Announce List
    </strong>
    will provide
              updates about Books to Prisons events, campaigns and
              projects and will be low traffic. This is meant for
              folks who support BtP and who want to know what BtP
              is up to but who aren't involved in the nuts and
              bolts (ex: coming to packing nights, fundraising,
              collecting books). You can sign up for the Announce
              List by going to
    <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/prisonlit-announce/" title="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/prisonlit-announce/">
     http://groups.yahoo.com/group/prisonlit-announce/</a>
    and then clicking Join this Group!.

    <strong>
     The Discussion List
    </strong>
    includes emails
              about the day-to-day operations of the group and asks
              for input or assistance on the latest Books to
              Prisons projects. Those involved in keeping Books to
              Prisons moving forward use this list as a way to
              communicate with members that participate (or who
              wish to participate) in BtP's core work. You can sign
              up for the Discussion List by going to
    <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/btpdiscussion/" title="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/btpdiscussion/">
     http://groups.yahoo.com/group/btpdiscussion/</a>
