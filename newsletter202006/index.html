    <em>"Books are how we teach ourselves to be better people. Books help us get
into the minds and hearts and experiences of other people. Books foster
empathy and they help us aspire to being a little better tomorrow than
we are today."</em>
    &ndash;Paul Constant, The
Seattle Review of Books

   <h2>New Fiscal Sponsor</h2>
   <p>
    In
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/newsletter202001/">a recent newsletter</a>
    we
announced
that we were transitioning to a new
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_sponsorship">
     fiscal
sponsor</a>. We're delighted to announce that the transition is
complete, and that we are now a fiscally sponsored project of
    <a href="https://www.empowermentworks.org">Empowerment WORKS</a>,
a 501c3 nonprofit organization. Empowerment WORKS focuses on social
change and unleashing the power of
collaboration in the relentless pursuit of a sustainable, just future for
all. As a sponsored project, we
can now once again accept
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/donate">tax-deductible donations</a>. We look
forward to a great relationship with Empowerment WORKS!
   </p>
   <h2>Response to the Coronavirus Pandemic</h2>
   <p>
    The coronavirus pandemic has forced us to suspend our regular volunteer sessions, but
we continue to do as much work as possible while keeping our volunteers safe. Our incoming
mail, which averages over 200 letters from incarcerated people each week, is sorted and read by
a dedicated team of home-based volunteers. Another team continues with the neverending
task of contacting prisons and departments of corrections to ensure that we have current
information on the rules for sending books to the prisoners in their custody. One
volunteer organized a book drive for
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/libros">2,000 Libros</a>
    that resulted in
147 books being sent to Arizona, including 82 that had been purchased online from local
bookstore
    <a href="https://www.politics-prose.com/">Politics and Prose</a>. Small
quantities of books have been sent to prison libraries in Oklahoma and Tennessee, a prison
book club in California, and individual prisoners in Arkansas, California, North Carolina,
Texas, Utah, and Virginia. We will continue doing what we can to serve prisoners while
keeping our volunteers safe and complying with local laws on social distancing.
   </p>
   <p>
    Being quarantined at home for an extended period has given some of our volunteers and
supporters new insights into why certain types of books are frequently requested by
prisoners. An article in The Washington Post titled
    <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2020/04/16/quarantine-readers/">
     "The
10 types of readers you meet during a quarantine"</a>
    describes categories of readers such as
"seize-the-day readers keeping busy with new skills" and
"escapists running away to fantastical worlds". Of the latter type of reader, the article says
that:
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    Readers are fleeing to appealing worlds that share little in common with our
own, like J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth and George R.R. Martin's Westeros. Hogwarts, too.
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    Just as described in the article, some of our volunteers and
supporters have been escaping into fantasy or attempting to learn new
skills while confined to home. One volunteer wrote that, "I had zero
interest in fantasy before the coronavirus came, but am now obsessed
with it because it provides my mind with a much-needed break from
reality. For the first time, I understand why fantasy novels figure so
prominently on our
    <a href="http://dcbookstoprisoners.org/donate-books/">
     list of
most-requested books</a>. Being stuck in my apartment day after day
without exercise is also making me understand why prisoners keep asking
for
    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1450429297/">
     books on bodyweight
exercise</a>."
   </p>
   <p>
    Sadly, the coronavirus pandemic has forced many prisons to restrict prisoners' movement,
putting an end to library visits.
    <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/05/01/a-state-by-state-look-at-coronavirus-in-prisons">
     The
coronavirus has also infected a horrifying number of prisoners.</a>
    Despite this, a
number of the incarcerated readers who have written to us have expressed concern for
    <em>us</em>. One recent letter read:
   </p>
   <p>
    <em>This is not a request for books. The only request I wish to make at this time is that
everyone exercise the necessary actions and precautions to maintain your health in
response to the CoronaVirus-COVID19. Hoping for the best for you and yours. &ndash;Jimmy</em>
   </p>
   <h2>Artwork from a Grateful Reader</h2>
   <p>
    Some prisoners thank us for the books we send them by donating postage stamps or writing
heartfelt letters. Others send us beautiful homemade cards like this one:
