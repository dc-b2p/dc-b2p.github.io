      Come out for a special charity hike to raise
                  postage money for DC Books to Prisons. The event
                  will consist of a short hike, a lunch, and a trip
                  to a used bookstore.
     </p>
     <p>
      We will meet at 10:15 AM just outside the
                  Grosvenor / Strathmore Metro Station on the Red
                  Line, (Rockville / North Bethesda, MD) by the
                  newspaper bins. Parking is free. Note that Metro
                  runs less frequently on the weekend and is
                  sometimes delayed due to track work.

    Total distance will be about 5 miles. Please ensure
              that you are capable of walking 5 miles. This is a
              point-to-point hike. We will walk from the metro to
              Rock Creek Trail, and head north, ending up at
    <a href="http://goldbergsnybagels.com/locations/">
     Goldberg's
              Bagels</a>. Featuring a broad menu of breakfast and
              lunch items and accolades for its bagel texture, we
              hope it will be a worthy replacement to our former
              lunch spot, Memsahib, which closed its doors after
              many years. After eating, we will adjourn to the
    <a href="https://www.folmc.org/bookstores/">
     Friends
              of the Montgomery County Library Bookstore</a>, a
              book lover's paradise; shop for yourself or a
              prisoner. Finally, we will walk to White Flint Metro
              Station. If you drive, you can take the metro one
              stop south. Predicted end time is around 2:15 PM.

    <a href="http://dcbookstoprisoners.org/">
     DC Books to
              Prisons</a>
    is the beneficiary of this hike. Most
              funds raised by this charity are used for postage
              costs. Hundreds of requests pour in each month; the
              biggest limiting factor is postage money. The
              suggested donation amount is $5, which is the cost of
              sending 3 pounds of books to a prisoner.
   </p>

    <strong><sup>

     </sup>
     Please bring a donation for DC
              Books to Prisons, your SmartTrip card, cash for lunch
              ($13 + tax, tip, extras), and water. If you would
              like to make a donation
     <a href="http://dcbookstoprisoners.org/donate">online</a>
     instead of bringing cash, that is fine. You can also
              make your donation in the form of self-adhesive
              postage stamps. Stamps worth $1.00 or $2.00 are
              especially appreciated.</strong>
