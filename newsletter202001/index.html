<p><i>"Books are how we teach ourselves to be better people. Books help us get
into the minds and hearts and experiences of other people. Books foster
empathy and they help us aspire to being a little better tomorrow than
we are today."</i> --Paul Constant, The
Seattle Review of Books
</p>


<h2>BtP Celebrates 20 Years of Operation</h2>

<p>On November 7, 2019, volunteers and supporters of DC
Book to Prisons (BtP) gathered at
<a href="http://smithpublictrustdc.com/">Smith Public
Trust</a> to celebrate BtP's 20th anniversary. Around
the room were cards with excerpts of letters received from
prisoners over the last 20 years describing how much books
mean to them. In a speech, one of BtP's board members explained
why we have done this work for 20 years and will continue to
send books to prisoners:
</p>

<p><em>"More than half of adult prisoners lack the basic
skills necessary for pursuing higher education, securing a
job, or participating fully in society. Studies also state
that education reduces the likelihood of committing
another crime after being released, and everyone in
this room plays a role in making that happen."</em>
</p>

<p>At the anniversary celebration, BtP introduced a new
logo, which can be seen at the top of this newsletter.
</p>

<p>Our thanks to Smith Public Trust for hosting the celebration,
and our thanks to all the volunteers and supporters who have
contributed to BtP's work over the last 20 years!
</p>

alt="[Photo of card displaying this letter: I gratefully received your address
from a friend of mine recently, it's so difficult in these time finding someone
whose hearts are in the right place and are willing to help with the inspirational
and educational needs of men and women in prison. Your organization and those who
support you with labor, donations or publications are truly an inspiration to us
and I am very grateful for everyone's kindness. I like Cookbooks and books on
Food Preservation, as a grandfather I hope to be able to in a couple of years be
released and cook for my grandkids whether it be cakes or pies or meal or snacks,
being a single grandparent's going to be tough enough so I gotta make an impression...

<h2>Change of Fiscal Sponsor</h2>

<p>For the last nine of our 20 years in operation, our fiscal sponsor
was the Washington Peace Center (WPC), which meant that monetary donations
for us had to be directed to WPC. Now, WPC is relinquishing the fiscal
sponsorship part of its programming. <strong>Donations for us will no
longer go to WPC, and we will briefly be unable to accept monetary
donations while finalizing arrangements with a new fiscal
sponsor.</strong> We will send out an update once we are accepting
monetary donations again.
</p>

<p>During the transition between fiscal sponsors, we will continue to
accept the donation of self-adhesive postage stamps of all denominations.
We will also continue to welcome <a href="/donate-books">book donations</a>.
</p>


<h2>Targeted Book Donations Transform Prison Life</h2>

<p>We welcome the donation of used books in all of the
categories included on our web site's list of <a
href="/donate-books">most-needed books</a>. However, some
categories of books are in higher demand than
we could ever hope to meet by receiving used books from
the public. Also, some prisons allow only books that are
brand new. </p>

<p>We are therefore immensely grateful to the individuals,
foundations, community groups, and companies that purchase
top-priority books and give them to us. Here are a few
examples of books that transform the lives of the
prisoners we serve: </p>

<p><strong>Educational books</strong> are frequently
requested. The top need is for college-level, paperback
dictionaries. Acquiring enough of these is a constant
struggle, and we're grateful to the many individuals who
purchase them for the prisoners we serve. GED study guides
are also popular. (Some of you may recall the lead article
in <a href="/newsletter201911/">our last newsletter</a>
about an incarcerated student who wrote to us after the
GED preparation materials we had sent him allowed him to
pass his GED exam.) A foundation has generously given
us a grant allowing us to purchase GED preparation books.
Wardens report that education transforms the
culture of a prison, allowing the individuals within the
prison to identify as "students" instead of "prisoners".
</p>

<p>Incarcerated people often ask for <strong>books that
will help them prepare for careers they can enter
after their release</strong>. We therefore receive many requests
for <em>Illegal to Legal</em> and books on plumbing,
welding, beekeeping, and other trades open to former
prisoners. Preparation for post-release careers can make
a considerable difference to recidivism rates, so we
greatly appreciate the donors who purchase requested
career-related titles.
</p>

<p>Some prisoners wish to to make cards or other items to
send to their families. They therefore request
<strong>books on activities like drawing or
crafts</strong>. A challenge with obtaining suitable
how-to-draw books
is that most prisons strictly prohibit books containing
<em>any</em> nudity, and it is common for books on drawing
to include a page or two of nudes. We therefore welcome
books on drawing "safe" subjects like faces, trees, or
dogs. One of the most amazing donations we ever received
consisted of multiple boxes of
<a href="https://www.drawbooks.com/">Peel Productions</a>
books, which are aimed at children and are therefore free
of nudity. Some prisoners express thanks for the
how-to-draw books
they've received by sending us beautiful handmade cards,
sometimes telling us that they learned to draw the animals
or flowers on the cards from the books we sent. Many
prisoners comment that drawing keeps them busy for hours
on end.
</p>

<p>Some prisoners simply want to pass the time
peacefully with a good book. A few request <strong>books in
Spanish</strong>, which are seldom found in significant
numbers in prison libraries. For years, the only
Spanish-language books in our collection were works of
classic literature, which were
seldom requested and were also beyond the reading level of
many of the prisoners requesting Spanish-language books.
Then, some dedicated supporters
started keeping an eye out for popular books in Spanish at
book sales, acquiring Harlequin romance novels, Star Wars
comic books, and other popular, easy-to-read books in
Spanish. We also received donations of
<a href="https://twitter.com/B2Pdc/status/1182337551543230464">Christian
books in Spanish</a>. Prisoners often share these books with
each other, then are able to converse about the worlds they
have discovered through reading.
</p>

<p>We will continue accepting book donations during our transition to a new
fiscal sponsor. If you would like to donate top-priority books to us,
please see our
<a href="https://www.politics-prose.com/wishlist/960">Politics and Prose
wish list</a> or

<h2>Letter from an Incarcerated Reader</h2>

<p>This letter was sent to us by Brandi, a prisoner in McLoud,
Oklahoma:
</p>

<p><em>"I'm trying to change my life... I just want to learn
all that I can while I am here so that I can make better
choices in the future... Thank you so much for the help
that you give us."</em>
