<h2>BtP Celebrates 20 Years of Operation</h2>

<p>On November 7, 2019, volunteers and supporters of DC Book to
Prisons (BtP) gathered at <a
href="http://smithpublictrustdc.com/">Smith Public Trust</a> to
celebrate BtP's 20th anniversary. Around the room were cards with
excerpts of letters received from prisoners over the last 20 years
describing how much books mean to them. In a speech, one of BtP's
board members explained why we have done this work for 20 years and
will continue to send books to prisoners:</p>

<p><em>"More than half of adult prisoners lack the basic skills
necessary for pursuing higher education, securing a job, or
participating fully in society. Studies also state that education
reduces the likelihood of committing another crime after being
released, and everyone in this room plays a role in making that
happen."</em></p>

<p>At the anniversary celebration, BtP introduced a new logo, which
can be seen at the top of this newsletter.</p>

<p>Our thanks to Smith Public Trust for hosting the celebration,
and our thanks to all the volunteers and supporters who have
contributed to BtP's work over the last 20 years!</p>

alt="[Photo of card displaying this letter: I gratefully received your address from a friend of mine recently, it's so difficult in these time finding someone whose hearts are in the right place and are willing to help with the inspirational and educational needs of men and women in prison. Your organization and those who support you with labor, donations or publications are truly an inspiration to us and I am very grateful for everyone's kindness. I like Cookbooks and books on Food Preservation, as a grandfather I hope to be able to in a couple of years be released and cook for my grandkids whether it be cakes or pies or meal or snacks, being a single grandparent's going to be tough enough so I gotta make an impression... - Robert, TX]"

<h2>Change of Fiscal Sponsor</h2>

<p>For the last nine of our 20 years in operation, our fiscal
sponsor was the Washington Peace Center (WPC), which meant that
monetary donations for us had to be directed to WPC. Now, WPC is
relinquishing the fiscal sponsorship part of its programming.
<strong>Donations for us will no longer go to WPC, and we will
briefly be unable to accept monetary donations while finalizing
arrangements with a new fiscal sponsor.</strong> We will send out
an update once we are accepting monetary donations again.</p>

<p>During the transition between fiscal sponsors, we will continue
to accept the donation of self-adhesive postage stamps of all
denominations. We will also continue to welcome <a
href="{{ site.baseurl }}/donate-books">book donations</a>.</p>
<h2>Targeted Book Donations Transform Prison Life</h2>

<p>We welcome the donation of used books in all of the categories
included on our web site's list of <a
href="{{ site.baseurl }}/donate-books">most-needed books</a>.
However, some categories of books are in higher demand than we
could ever hope to meet by receiving used books from the public.
Also, some prisons allow only books that are brand new.</p>

<p>We are therefore immensely grateful to the individuals,
foundations, community groups, and companies that purchase
top-priority books and give them to us. Here are a few examples of
books that transform the lives of the prisoners we serve:</p>

<p><strong>Educational books</strong> are frequently requested. The
top need is for college-level, paperback dictionaries. Acquiring
enough of these is a constant struggle, and we're grateful to the
many individuals who purchase them for the prisoners we serve. GED
study guides are also popular. (Some of you may recall the lead
article in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/newsletter201911/">our
last newsletter</a> about an incarcerated student who wrote to us
after the GED preparation materials we had sent him allowed him to
pass his GED exam.) A foundation has generously given us a grant
allowing us to purchase GED preparation books. Wardens report that
education transforms the culture of a prison, allowing the
individuals within the prison to identify as "students" instead of
"prisoners".</p>

<p>Incarcerated people often ask for <strong>books that will help
them prepare for careers they can enter after their
release</strong>. We therefore receive many requests for
<em>Illegal to Legal</em> and books on plumbing, welding,
beekeeping, and other trades open to former prisoners. Preparation
for post-release careers can make a considerable difference to
recidivism rates, so we greatly appreciate the donors who purchase
requested career-related titles.</p>

<p>Some prisoners wish to to make cards or other items to send to
their families. They therefore request <strong>books on activities
like drawing or crafts</strong>. A challenge with obtaining
suitable how-to-draw books is that most prisons strictly prohibit
books containing <em>any</em> nudity, and it is common for books on
drawing to include a page or two of nudes. We therefore welcome
books on drawing "safe" subjects like faces, trees, or dogs. One of
the most amazing donations we ever received consisted of multiple
boxes of <a href="https://www.drawbooks.com/">Peel Productions</a>
books, which are aimed at children and are therefore free of
nudity. Some prisoners express thanks for the how-to-draw books
they've received by sending us beautiful handmade cards, sometimes
telling us that they learned to draw the animals or flowers on the
cards from the books we sent. Many prisoners comment that drawing
keeps them busy for hours on end.</p>

<p>Some prisoners simply want to pass the time peacefully with a
good book. A few request <strong>books in Spanish</strong>, which
are seldom found in significant numbers in prison libraries. For
years, the only Spanish-language books in our collection were works
of classic literature, which were seldom requested and were also
beyond the reading level of many of the prisoners requesting
Spanish-language books. Then, some dedicated supporters started
keeping an eye out for popular books in Spanish at book sales,
acquiring Harlequin romance novels, Star Wars comic books, and
other popular, easy-to-read books in Spanish. We also received
donations of <a
href="https://twitter.com/B2Pdc/status/1182337551543230464">Christian
books in Spanish</a>. Prisoners often share these books with each
other, then are able to converse about the worlds they have
discovered through reading.</p>

<p>We will continue accepting book donations during our transition
to a new fiscal sponsor. If you would like to donate top-priority
books to us, please see our <a

wish list</a> or <a

<h2>Letter from an Incarcerated Reader</h2>

<p>This letter was sent to us by Brandi, a prisoner in McLoud,
Oklahoma:</p>

<p><em>"I'm trying to change my life... I just want to learn all
that I can while I am here so that I can make better choices in the
future... Thank you so much for the help that you give
us."</em></p>
