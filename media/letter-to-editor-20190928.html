   <p>
    Thanks for shedding light on the arbitrary restrictions on books for prison inmates. The web
of rules and bans seriously obstruct how almost 1.5 million men and women in U.S. prisons can
educate themselves, learn needed skills to help them make it on the outside or just have
something to read to ease the stress and boredom of prison life.

    We're grateful when publications draw attention to prison issues, especially prison literacy.
But next time The Post writes about groups working to get books to men and women behind bars,
it doesn't  have to go to the other Washington for an example.
