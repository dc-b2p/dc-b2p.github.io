              Wheelchair access
            </h2>
            <p>
              We are in the basement of Foundry Church, at 1500
              16th Street NW in Washington DC. There are two ramps
              into the building, one on P Street and the other on
              16th Street. Please use only the 16th Street ramp.
              Go up the ramp and ring the doorbell, and
              someone in the office will remotely activate an
              electric door opener.
            </p>
            <p>
              You will then need
              to take one of two elevators down to the basement. We
              recommend asking the receptionist for directions to
              the older, smaller elevator. In the elevator, press
              "1" to go down to the basement. After exiting the
              elevator, turn right. You will soon see our room on
              your left, opposite the men's restroom.
              If you instead use the newer, larger
              elevator, the route is complicated, and should be
              attempted only in the company of a church staff
              person who can unlock and open doors for you.
              Without a staff escort, it would be possible to
              become trapped.
              <strong>[As of January 26, 2022, the older, smaller
              elevator is out of service, and we do not know
              when it will be repaired.]</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Most of our work involves reading prisoners' letters
              then selecting appropriate books from the collection
              on our shelves. Some shelves cannot be reached from
              wheelchair height. However, there are so many letters
              to choose from that it's easy to pick letters
              requesting books on topics that are stored on lower
              shelves.
            </p>
            <p>
              The women's and men's restrooms on our floor
              are more-or-less ADA-compliant. However, the
              doors require a lot of force to open. Ask anyone
              wearing a red "Ask Me" button for help if you need
              someone to open a door for you. The church has two
              unisex restrooms, including one that is fully
              ADA-compliant and much more spacious than the
              restrooms near our room. Unfortunately, the unisex
              restrooms are in a wing that is kept locked in the
              evening for security reasons. If you have an
              opposite-sex attendant and are concerned about which
              restroom you can use, talk to us and we'll see what
              we can do.

            <p>
              A lot of important information is shared during the
              orientation that all volunteers must attend before
              volunteering. If you are deaf or hard-of-hearing,
              please alert us in advance so we can ensure that your
              orientation will be provided in a way that will allow
              you to understand everything.
            </p>
            <p>
              We have two volunteers who can provide orientations
              in ASL or PSE. If you will need a signed orientation,
              please contact us to schedule one.
            </p>
            <p>
              The building's air conditioning system generates a very
              loud noise within our room throughout the summer months,
              causing the room to be very inhospitable to hard-of-hearing
              volunteers. We are aware of the problem, and unfortunately
              cannot do anything to alleviate it.

            <p>
              Unfortunately, almost all the work done on Wednesday
              nights requires the ability to read average-sized print.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you have low vision and are trying to find our
              room for the first time, here are some details that
              may be helpful: To access the building, you will need
              to go up either steps or a ramp on 16th Street and ring
              a doorbell that's to the left of the entrance.
              Upon entering, ask the receptionist
              inside to point you in the direction of the stairs or
              older elevator, and go down to the basement. If you
              take the stairs, turn left at the bottom and walk a
              very short distance. We are in the room that will be to
              your left, opposite the men's restroom. The restrooms on our floor are
              indicated by Braille signs located 44-45 inches above
              the floor. We regret that there is no Braille sign at the entrance
              to our room.
              If you go to the basement in the
              older of the church's two elevators instead of taking
              the stairs, the directions are the same except that
              you should initially turn right, not left. Do not use the
              newer elevator without a staff escort, as the route from
              it involves going through locked doors.

              We're aware that some disabilities make people
              sensitive to temperature, lighting conditions, and
              unexpected noises. Unfortunately, we operate out of a single
              room, and we can't adjust the temperature or change
              the type of lighting (which is fluorescent). We also
              can't do much about the noise level, which can be
              high, especially when there is
              a choir practicing down the hall.
