<p><i>"Books are how we teach ourselves to be better people. Books help us get 
into the minds and hearts and experiences of other people. Books foster 
empathy and they help us aspire to being a little better tomorrow than 
we are today."</i> --Paul Constant, The 
Seattle Review of Books

<h2>New Fiscal Sponsor</h2>

<p>In <a href="/newsletter202001/">a recent newsletter</a> we announced that we were 
transitioning to a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_sponsorship">fiscal 
sponsor</a>. We're delighted to announce that the transition is 
complete, and that we are now a fiscally sponsored project of 
<a href="https://www.empowermentworks.org">Empowerment WORKS</a>, a 501c3 nonprofit
organization. Because of this, we are
once again able to accept both online donations and checks. 
We look forward to a great relationship with Empowerment WORKS!
</p>

<h2>Response to the Coronavirus Pandemic</h2>

<p>The coronavirus pandemic has forced us to suspend our regular volunteer sessions, but 
we continue to do as much work as possible while keeping our volunteers safe. Our incoming 
mail, which averages _____ letters from incarcerated people each week, is sorted and read 
by a dedicated team of home-based volunteers. Another team continues with the neverending 
task of contacting prisons and departments of corrections to ensure that we have current 
information on the rules for sending books to the prisoners in their custody. One 
volunteer organized a book drive for 2,000 Libros, asking for books to be purchased online 
from local bookstore Politics and Prose. Small quantities of books have been sent to 
prison libraries in Oklahoma and Tennessee, a prison book club in _______, and individual 
prisoners in Arkansas, California, North Carolina, Texas, Utah, and Virginia. We will 
continue doing what we can to serve prisoners while keeping our volunteers safe and 
complying with local laws on social distancing.

</p>

<p>Being quarantined at home for an extended period has given some of our volunteers and
supporters new insights into why certain types of books are frequently requested by
prisoners. An article in The Washington Post titled
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment-/2020/04/16/quarantine-readers/">"The
10 types of readers you meet during a quarantine"</a> describes categories of readers such as
"seize-the-day readers keeping busy with new skills" and
"escapists running away to fantastical worlds". Of the latter type of reader, the article says
that:
</p>

<blockquote>Readers are fleeing to appealing worlds that share little in common with our 
own, like J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth and George R.R. Martin's Westeros. Hogwarts, too. 
</blockquote>

<p>Just as described in the article, some of our volunteers and supporters have been 
escaping into fantasy or attempting to learn new skills while confined to home. One 
volunteer wrote that, "I had zero interest in fantasy before the coronavirus came, but am 
now obsessed with it because it provides my mind with a much-needed break from reality. 
For the first time, I understand why fantasy novels figure so prominently on our 
<a href="http://dcbookstoprisoners.org/donate-books/">list of most-requested books</a>.
Being stuck in my apartment day after day without exercise is also making me understand why
prisoners keep asking for books on bodyweight exercise." <strong>[The words "books on
bodyweight exercise" should link to the relevant title on our Amazon wish list]</strong>
</p>

<p>Sadly, the covid-19 pandemic has forced many prisons to restrict prisoners' movement,
putting an end to library visits. 
<a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/05/01/a-state-by-state-look-at-coronavirus-in-prisons">The
novel coronavirus has also infected a horrifying number of prisoners.</a> Despite this, a
number of the incarcerated readers who have written to us have expressed concern for 
<em>us</em>. One recent letter read:
</p>

<p><em>This is not a request for books. The only request I wish to make at this time is that
everyone exercise the necessary actions and precautions to maintain your health in
response to the CoronaVirus-COVID19. Hoping for the best for you and yours. --Jimmy</em>
</p>


<h2>Artwork from a Grateful Reader</h2>

<p>A number of prisoners thank us for books by sending us homemade cards or drawings.
This was sent to us by _______. [Insert photo]
</p>


<h2>How Wikipedia Helps Us Serve Prisoners</h2>

<p>We are blessed to have many volunteers who are deeply knowledgeable about books, and
blessed also to have many books on our shelves. However, sometimes we lack either the
knowledge or materials we need to serve a prisoner. A useful resource in these situations is
<a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>.
</p>

<p>How does Wikipedia help us? In several ways:
<ul>

<li>When we receive a letter asking for books by a particular author, and the volunteer reading
the letter is unfamiliar with the author, Wikipedia provides a quick way to determine the
correct genre. This greatly speeds up the process of finding suitable books.</li>

<li>When a volunteer is considering sending a particular book to a prisoner but isn't sure 
whether the book includes content that's banned in prisons, it's often possible to find a 
summary of the book on Wikipedia. There are, of course, many other web sites that also 
provide information on books, but many avoid spoilers. Wikipedia holds nothing back.</li>

<li>When an incarcerated reader requests books on an obscure non-fiction subject, a Wikipedia
printout can be sent in lieu of a book. Because Wikipedia has articles in many languages,
we can even use Wikipedia printouts when responding to requests from prisoners who have
limited proficiency in English. Fortunately, Wikipedia allows text from its articles to be
shared under a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License">Creative Commons License</a>, 
so we do not violate any copyright
laws when creating printouts for incarcerated readers.</li>

</ul>
</p>

<p>We are grateful for this resource that helps us meet the demand for educational materials
in prisons.
</p>
