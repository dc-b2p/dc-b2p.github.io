<p><i>"Books are how we teach ourselves to be better people. Books help us get 
into the minds and hearts and experiences of other people. Books foster 
empathy and they help us aspire to being a little better tomorrow than 
we are today."</i> --Paul Constant, The 
Seattle Review of Books

<h2>Letter from a Prisoner in Arkansas
</h2>

<p><em>
Howdy!</em>
</p>

<p><em>I am once again writing, as I've done many times over the years, to request books. But 
first: thank you! Thank you for the countless joy-filled hours extending into days, weeks, 
and months... When my eyes scan the sentences printed upon the page... my thoughts race 
over hills, valleys and mountains, through cities, countries and worlds heretofore unknown 
in endless adventures, inhabiting the hearts and minds of myriad characters planted in the 
fertile fields of my imagination where I am truly free. Free as I ever was or will be, as 
free as you to go anywhere or do anything. Free to follow along in others' footsteps from 
Lucy on that African plain with the first known of our ancestors' footfalls to humanity's 
collective one giant leap to the moon with Neil Armstrong. Free to dream the beginning 
footsteps of my own future. Free in mind and memory to meet others who also once dared to 
dream, to go where everyone and no one has gone before. Free to believe in today becoming 
a better tomorrow with the cover of every book I open, opening those dreamland doors and 
setting my feet inside... the outside, the</em> other <em>side, that resides inside us 
all.</em>
</p>

<p><em>But ultimately, it is because of you, who put the books in my hands, that I am set 
free to so dream.</em>
</p>

<p><em>Thank you!</em>
</p>



<h2>Adjusting to the New Normal</h2>

<p>For 15 years, we operated out of a room in the basement of Foundry United Methodist 
Church, often having as many as 30 volunteers in the room in one evening. That came to an 
end in March, when Foundry closed its building in response to the pandemic. Foundry will 
reopen after the District of Columbia enters Phase Three of its coronavirus 
recovery, but that may not happen until well into 2021.
</p>

<p>In order to continue providing service to prisoners
while also ensuring the safety of our 
volunteers, during the summer we distributed our books and other supplies among makeshift 
sites that each are used by only 1-2 volunteers. Thrifty volunteers found creative 
solutions to the problem of our bookshelves still being in Foundry's basement, repurposing 
old TV stands and tables. One volunteer constructed these shelves out of cardboard boxes.
</p>

<p><img src="homemade-shelves.jpg">
</p>

<p>We continue to engage in a multi-step process to ensure that each book package will comply 
with the rules of the prison it is being sent to. Books are selected by one volunteer then 
handed off to a second volunteer for quality control and packing. This usually entails 
meeting outside, and has made us avid followers of weather forecasts.
</p>

<p>Other volunteers receive book donations from the public, sort them by genre, and drive 
them to the sites where they are needed. On one memorable occasion, heavy rain came down 
while volunteers raced to transfer heavy boxes of books between cars.
</p>

<p>Obtaining enough of the right kinds of books has been more challenging during the pandemic, and
we are grateful to donors who have purchased books from our 
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/XST0TQ95ZW67/">Amazon</a> and 
<a href="https://www.politics-prose.com/wishlist/960">Politics and Prose</a> wish
lists or donated funds for purchasing books.
</p>

<p>We are driven by the awareness that prisoners' need for books has never been greater. Many 
of the prisoners requesting books from us during the pandemic have commented on the 
extreme isolation they are experiencing during the pandemic, saying that they have gone 
nine months without access to libraries, classes, or religious services. Books are now one 
of their few sources of entertainment or spiritual sustenance.
</p>

<p>Despite all of the challenges of sending books to prisoners without access to our room in 
Foundry's basement, we are now sending books at around the same rate we did before the 
pandemic. Thank you to everyone who has made this possible.
</p>


<h2>Card from a Prisoner in Texas</h2>

<p>Prisoners often thank us for the books they receive from us by sending us homemade 
cards. Making these cards is one of the few outlets prisoners have for creativity, and in 
some cases the cards are very elaborate. One prisoner sent us this extraordinary card:
</p>

<p><img src="card-from-angel.jpg" alt="[Pleated card showing butterflies approaching a
heart-shaped plastic window in which a smaller heart is hanging by a thread. Written on the
smaller heart are the words 'Thank you'.]">
</p>

<p>Sadly, although prisoners can make and send cards like this, in many cases they cannot 
receive cards from people on the outside. Rules have been 
introduced in many prisons prohibiting all cards except for those shipped directly from a 
handful of private companies.
</p>


<h2>Thank You</h2>

<p>Our work during this especially challenging year has been possible only because of the 
support we've received from all of you who have donated books, money, packing supplies, 
and time. The value of your contributions is expressed well by this letter we received 
from a prisoner in North Carolina:
</p>

<p><em>"Greetings and blessings... I thank you for making free literature available to 
prisoners like me who don't have the resources to buy a book... Friends, today more than 
ever in these days of crisis and with the viral pandemic striking the nation, a book helps 
us keep terror of this mortal virus out of our heads. Also, a book is a perfect companion 
in a lonely cell... I have learned that a book is a good friend that teaches, advises, and 
guides you... Some people think that [a book] serves only to kill time, but they aren't 
using their imagination to understand what the book is trying to communicate. Others like 
the world of literature and we embark on this great adventure with the help of you who 
make it possible for us to have a book in our hands. Good friends, many thanks!"
</em></p>
