<p><i>"Books are how we teach ourselves to be better people. Books help us get 
into the minds and hearts and experiences of other people. Books foster 
empathy and they help us aspire to being a little better tomorrow than 
we are today."</i> --Paul Constant, The 
Seattle Review of Books
</p>


<h2>New Fiscal Sponsor</h2>

<p>In <a href="/newsletter202001/">a recent newsletter</a> we announced that we were 
transitioning to a new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_sponsorship">fiscal 
sponsor</a>. We're delighted to announce that the transition is 
complete, and that we are now a 
fiscally sponsored program of <a 
href="https://www.empowermentworks.org">Empowerment WORKS</a>. <strong>[Maya: What additional
text should be added here? Presumably, we won't want to say anything in this paragraph
about how our new relationship with EW affects the processing of donations, because it's
typically better to give how-to-donate inforation at the <em>end</em> of a newsletter.
However, it seems like we should say SOMETHING more here.]</strong>

</p>

<h2>Response to the Covid-19 Pandemic</h2>

<p>The covid-19 pandemic has forced us to suspend our regular volunteer sessions, but we 
continue to do as much work as we can from our volunteers' homes. Our incoming mail, which 
averages _____ letters from incarcerated people each week, is sorted and read by a 
dedicated team of home-based volunteers. Other volunteers do what they can to 
respond to requests for books. In one instance, a volunteer printed articles downloaded 
from the Internet to send to a prisoner in lieu of books. We will continue doing what we can
to serve prisoners while keeping our volunteers safe and complying with local laws on social
distancing.
</p>

<p>Being quarantined at home for an extended period has given some of our volunteers and
supporters new insights into why certain types of books are frequently requested by
prisoners. An article in The Washington Post titled
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment-/2020/04/16/quarantine-readers/">"The
10 types of readers you meet during a quarantine"</a> describes categories of readers such as
"seize-the-day readers keeping busy with new skills" and
"escapists running away to fantastical worlds". Of the latter type of reader, the article says
that:
</p>

<blockquote>Readers are fleeing to appealing worlds that share little in common with our 
own, like J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth and George R.R. Martin's Westeros. Hogwarts, too. 
</blockquote>

<p>Just as described in the article, some of our volunteers and supporters have been 
escaping into fantasy or attempting to learn new skills while confined to home. One 
volunteer wrote that, "I had zero interest in fantasy before the coronavirus came, but am 
now obsessed with it because it provides my mind with a much-needed break from reality. 
For the first time, I understand why fantasy novels figure so prominently on our 
<a href="http://dcbookstoprisoners.org/donate-books/">list of most-requested books</a>.
Being stuck in my apartment day after day without exercise is also making me understand why
prisoners keep asking for books on bodyweight exercise." <strong>[The words "books on
bodyweight exercise" should link to the relevant title on our Amazon wish list]</strong>
</p>

<p>Sadly, the covid-19 pandemic has forced many prisons to restrict prisoners' movement,
putting an end to library visits. 
<a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/04/24/tracking-the-spread-of-coronavirus-in-prisons">The 
novel coronavirus has also infected a horrifying number of prisoners.</a> Despite this, a
number of the incarcerated readers who have written to us have expressed concern for 
<em>us</em>. One recent letter read:
</p>

<p><em>This is not a request for books. The only request I wish to make at this time is that
everyone exercise the necessary actions and precautions to maintain your health in
response to the CoronaVirus-COVID19. Hoping for the best for you and yours. -Jimmy</em>

<p>A number of prisoners thank us for books by sending us homemade cards or drawings.
