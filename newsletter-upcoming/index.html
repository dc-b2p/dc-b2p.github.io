<p><i>"Books are how we teach ourselves to be better people. Books help us get 
into the minds and hearts and experiences of other people. Books foster 
empathy and they help us aspire to being a little better tomorrow than 
we are today."</i> --Paul Constant, The 
Seattle Review of Books
</p>


<h2>A Milestone for DC Books to Prisons As We Become Our Own Non-Profit
</h2>

<p>DC Books to Prisons (BtP) is proud to announce that we will soon become an
incorporated 501(c)(3) non-profit. We will no longer operate under the umbrella of
<a href="https://www.empowermentworks.org">Empowerment WORKS</a>, the 
wonderful partner that enabled our work for the past
year. With the change, we will have our own non-profit status and all
donations will flow directly to our organization. We are currently making
the transition and will begin acting independently on July 1, 2021.
</p>

<p>Founded in 1999, BtP mails books to thousands of people incarcerated in
more than 600 prisons across the country. In that time, BtP has relied on
dedicated supporters who have donated time, books, and money -- enabling
the good work of the organization to continue even through the pandemic.
</p>

<p>As a longstanding organization that's growing financially, BtP will
benefit from our new non-profit status because it will add to our
credibility and potential for growth. For example, the organization will
have more freedom with fundraising such as with grant requests and
corporate donor-matching. BtP celebrates this good news of independence as
we look forward to doing even more good work to benefit prisoners.
</p>


<h2>Letters from the People We Serve</h2>

<p>We continue to send hundreds of books to incarcerated readers every week,
using the <a href="/newsletter202012/#newnormal">
pandemic-friendly facilities and procedures described in our December 2020 newsletter</a>.
These books are sent in response to letters from prisoners requesting
books and expressing how much the books previously sent to them helped them. We have 
always included a few letter excerpts in our newsletters, but in this newsletter we're 
sharing a wider selection. In some cases, spelling has been fixed and punctuation 
added, but no changes have been made to the wording except as indicated by square 
brackets.
</p>

<p>Many prisoners request books to help them learn new skills and prepare for careers:
</p>

<p><em>"I'm starving for knowledge. I would love some educational books... I need a 
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/087779295X/">dictionary</a>. I want to learn how 
to garden [and] manage a business with food involved like 
food trucks and small diners."</em> --Taylor, Kansas
</p>

<p><em>"I need a concise study guide for English grammar. I need a really good lexicon. And 
finally, if I can receive a vocabulary builder for everyday conversations, that would be a 
blessing! I understand that [in] this day and age, you must have good verbal conversation 
skills, plus good writing skills."</em> --Joshua, Texas
</p>

<p><em>"Recibi su paquete de estudios de ingles primer nivel, el cual le estoy muy 
agradecido. Ya que me ha sido de gran utilidad en mi aprendizaje... Hoy les escribo con el 
fin de pedirles el libro de segundo nivel."</em> <strong>TRANSLATION:</strong> <em>"I 
received your package of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1438010389">level-one 
English</a> study [material], for which I'm very grateful. It has already been of great 
use in my learning. Today I'm writing to request 
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1438010516">the second-level book</a>."</em> --Daniel, 
California
</p>

<p><em>"I am currently in my fourteenth year of incarceration, and am blessed with an opportunity 
to go to seminary and earn a degree in biblical studies. So I am interested in books in 
this field as well as health and fitness and nutrition and non-profit. I have less than 
nine years until I see parole. My goals are to educate myself in non-profit organization. 
I would like to have a traveling prison ministry to take the gospel of Jesus Christ to 
inmates across the United States. Also, a drug addiction counselor. My incarceration was 
due to a drug addiction, so I would like to reach out to those who are drowning in their 
addiction."</em> --Anthony, Texas
</p>

<p>Other people behind bars simply want a diversion:
</p>

<p><em>"I am not real choosy and will read whatever you send. I am 72 years old in close custody. 
All I have to do is read and draw."</em> --Richard, Texas
</p>

<p><em>"I am currently incarcerated in solitary confinement with no human interaction. I've been 
in solitary for 2 years. I own only 2 books... I've probably read both books a hundred 
times. It's the only thing keeping my sanity. I'm truly hoping you can help me with some 
books. Maybe a few study books, comics, and books for entertainment."</em> --E., Texas
</p>

<p>Many letters over the past year have referred to the coronavirus pandemic:
</p>

<p><em>"You don't know how much you help us to keep ourselves calmer and focused on something
positive and not think bad thoughts, and [even] more now because we're in quarantine
without being able to receive visits from our loved ones. We're kept isolated and can't go
anywhere or get hot food... There are already more than 600 reported cases of sick
prisoners in this unit."</em> --Luis, Texas
</p>

<p><em>"I hope [DC Books to Prisons] is still in business in spite of
coronavirus. I know the prisons are."</em> --Eugene, Nevada
</p>

<p><em>"I hope you all are doing well, as well as your family members too. I don't know if this 
is the best time for requesting books. We know that everything is happening right now is 
very stressful... I pray that God keep you all safe."</em> --Rene, South Carolina
</p>

<p>Some letters come from people who are trying to transform themselves:
</p>

<p><em>"I'm working on bettering myself and helping kids avoid making the mistakes I made. I'm 
interested in receiving books that will help me with these goals. Please send me books 
on... self help and self empowerment. Any non-fiction that helps a person to become a 
better person."</em> --Jonathan, California
</p>

<p><em>"I really like books that help you with human behavior, books that talk about feeling, 
thinking, and the human spirit... I'm asking you for books of this type because... I'm 
seeking to change many things about myself. I'm seeking help in thinking better and having 
more control of my feelings and impulses. I want to be a better human being, 
<a href="www.politics-prose.com/book/9781797201542">thinking 
better and living better</a>."</em> --F., California
</p>

<p>Some letters describe the sharing of books:
</p>

<p><em>"I want to start by saying 'thank you' for helping those that are locked up and don't have 
access to books. You sent me some comic books and a good novel and I just want to say that 
I passed them on to other inmates and they also enjoyed them so thanks."</em> --Steven, 
California
</p>

<p>Would you like to see more excerpts from prisoners' letters? We often post short 
excerpts to <a href="https://twitter.com/b2pdc">Twitter</a>, and they can be read even by 
people without Twitter accounts.
