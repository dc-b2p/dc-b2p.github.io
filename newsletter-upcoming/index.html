<h2>A Milestone for DC Books to Prisons As We Become Our Own
Non-Profit</h2>

<p>DC Books to Prisons (BtP) is proud to announce that we will soon
become an incorporated 501(c)(3) non-profit. We will no longer
operate under the umbrella of <a
href="https://www.empowermentworks.org">Empowerment WORKS</a>, the
wonderful partner that enabled our work for the past year. With the
change, we will have our own non-profit status and all donations
will flow directly to our organization. We are currently making the
transition and will begin acting independently on July 1, 2021.</p>

<p>Founded in 1999, BtP mails books to thousands of people
incarcerated in more than 600 prisons across the country. In that
time, BtP has relied on dedicated supporters who have donated time,
books, and money &ndash; enabling the good work of the organization to
continue even through the pandemic.</p>

<p>As a longstanding organization that's growing financially, BtP
will benefit from our new non-profit status because it will add to
our credibility and potential for growth. For example, the
organization will have more freedom with fundraising such as with
grant requests and corporate donor-matching. BtP celebrates this
good news of independence as we look forward to doing even more
good work to benefit prisoners.</p>

<h2>Letters from the People We Serve</h2>

<p>We continue to send hundreds of books to incarcerated readers
every week, using the <a
href="{{ site.baseurl }}/newsletter202012/#newnormal">pandemic-friendly
facilities and procedures described in our December 2020
newsletter</a>. These books are sent in response to letters from
prisoners requesting books and expressing how much the books
previously sent to them helped them. We have always included a few
letter excerpts in our newsletters, but in this newsletter we're
sharing a wider selection. In some cases, spelling has been fixed
and punctuation added, but no changes have been made to the wording
except as indicated by square brackets.</p>

<p>Many prisoners request books to help them learn new skills and
prepare for careers:</p>

<p><em>"I'm starving for knowledge. I would love some educational
books... I need a <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/087779295X/">dictionary</a>. I want to
learn how to garden [and] manage a business with food involved like
food trucks and small diners."</em> &ndash;Taylor, Kansas</p>

<p><em>"I need a concise study guide for English grammar. I need a
really good lexicon. And finally, if I can receive a vocabulary
builder for everyday conversations, that would be a blessing! I
understand that [in] this day and age, you must have good verbal
conversation skills, plus good writing skills."</em> &ndash;Joshua,
Texas</p>

<p><em>"Recibi su paquete de estudios de ingles primer nivel, el
cual le estoy muy agradecido. Ya que me ha sido de gran utilidad en
mi aprendizaje... Hoy les escribo con el fin de pedirles el libro
de segundo nivel."</em> <strong>TRANSLATION:</strong> <em>"I
received your package of <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1438010389">level-one English</a> study
[material], for which I'm very grateful. It has already been of
great use in my learning. Today I'm writing to request <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1438010516">the second-level
book</a>."</em> &ndash;Daniel, California</p>

<p><em>"I am currently in my fourteenth year of incarceration, and
am blessed with an opportunity to go to seminary and earn a degree
in biblical studies. So I am interested in books in this field as
well as health and fitness and nutrition and non-profit. I have
less than nine years until I see parole. My goals are to educate
myself in non-profit organization. I would like to have a traveling
prison ministry to take the gospel of Jesus Christ to inmates
across the United States. Also, a drug addiction counselor. My
incarceration was due to a drug addiction, so I would like to reach
out to those who are drowning in their addiction."</em> &ndash;Anthony,
Texas</p>

<p>Other people behind bars simply want a diversion:</p>

<p><em>"I am not real choosy and will read whatever you send. I am
72 years old in close custody. All I have to do is read and
draw."</em> &ndash;Richard, Texas</p>

<p><em>"I am currently incarcerated in solitary confinement with no
human interaction. I've been in solitary for 2 years. I own only 2
books... I've probably read both books a hundred times. It's the
only thing keeping my sanity. I'm truly hoping you can help me with
some books. Maybe a few study books, comics, and books for
entertainment."</em> &ndash;E., Texas</p>

<p>Many letters over the past year have referred to the coronavirus
pandemic:</p>

<p><em>"You don't know how much you help us to keep ourselves
calmer and focused on something positive and not think bad
thoughts, and [even] more now because we're in quarantine without
being able to receive visits from our loved ones. We're kept
isolated and can't go anywhere or get hot food... There are already
more than 600 reported cases of sick prisoners in this unit."</em>
&ndash;Luis, Texas</p>

<p><em>"I hope [DC Books to Prisons] is still in business in spite
of coronavirus. I know the prisons are."</em> &ndash;Eugene, Nevada</p>

<p><em>"I hope you all are doing well, as well as your family
members too. I don't know if this is the best time for requesting
books. We know that everything is happening right now is very
stressful... I pray that God keep you all safe."</em> &ndash;Rene, South
Carolina</p>

<p>Some letters come from people who are trying to transform
themselves:</p>

<p><em>"I'm working on bettering myself and helping kids avoid
making the mistakes I made. I'm interested in receiving books that
will help me with these goals. Please send me books on... self help
and self empowerment. Any non-fiction that helps a person to become
a better person."</em> &ndash;Jonathan, California</p>

<p><em>"I really like books that help you with human behavior,
books that talk about feeling, thinking, and the human spirit...
I'm asking you for books of this type because... I'm seeking to
change many things about myself. I'm seeking help in thinking
better and having more control of my feelings and impulses. I want
to be a better human being, <a
href="https://www.politics-prose.com/book/9781797201542">thinking better
and living better</a>."</em> &ndash;F., California</p>

<p>Some letters describe the sharing of books:</p>

<p><em>"I want to start by saying 'thank you' for helping those
that are locked up and don't have access to books. You sent me some
comic books and a good novel and I just want to say that I passed
them on to other inmates and they also enjoyed them so
thanks."</em> &ndash;Steven, California</p>

<p>Would you like to see more excerpts from prisoners' letters? We
often post short excerpts to <a
href="https://twitter.com/b2pdc">Twitter</a>, and they can be read even
by people without Twitter accounts.</p>
