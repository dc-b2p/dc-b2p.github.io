   <p>
    On Independence Day 2018, with freedom very much on the
mind, DC Books to Prisons announced our support of 2,000
Libros, a project to free the minds of the country's
youngest prisoners: immigrant children in detention centers.
While initial efforts focused on Spanish-language and
bilingual books for early to mid level readers, the program
continued to evolve with ever-changing needs.
   </p>
   <p>
    The number of children referred to ORR during 2020 fell to
its lowest level since 2013, but those numbers started
climbing in 2021, peaking at more than 20,000 in April/May
2021. Today, shelters under ORR house thousands of
unaccompanied children (mostly teens) from Central and South
America along with an increasing number from Pakistan and
Afghanistan.
   </p>
   <p>
    While case managers in the ORR seek to reunite these
children with their families, these shelters need:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Teen Chapter Books (Spanish, Urdu, Arabic, Punjabi, Dari
(Farsi), Pashtu, English)
    </li>
    <li>
     Qurans (Urdu, Arabic, Punjabi, Dari (Farsi), Pashtu,
English)
    </li>
    <li>
     Spanish-language Bibles
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
   </p>
   <p>
    Detention centers have been contacted regarding donation
policies, needs, and the numbers and ages of kids being
held. Between the first batch of books (mailed July 14,
2018) and January 28, 2021, 2,000 Libros had distributed
approximately 6,800 books and 1,510 magazines to 27
organizations across the country. Some of these
organizations had hundreds (and one had thousands) of
children in their care. During the pandemic, 2,000 Libros
sent another 1,000 books.
   </p>
   <p>
    Shipping thousands of books around the country entails
considerable postage costs. We are grateful to
    <a href="https://www.bardsalley.com">Bards Alley</a>
    and all the individuals who have donated money and books.
Donations can be made through an
