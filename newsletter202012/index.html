<h2>Letter from Christopher in Arkansas</h2>

<p><em>Howdy!</em></p>

<p><em>I am once again writing, as I've done many times over the
years, to request books. But first: thank you! Thank you for the
countless joy-filled hours extending into days, weeks, and
months... When my eyes scan the sentences printed upon the page...
my thoughts race over hills, valleys and mountains, through cities,
countries and worlds heretofore unknown in endless adventures,
inhabiting the hearts and minds of myriad characters planted in the
fertile fields of my imagination where I am truly free. Free as I
ever was or will be, as free as you to go anywhere or do anything.
Free to follow along in others' footsteps from Lucy on that African
plain with the first known of our ancestors' footfalls to
humanity's collective one giant leap to the moon with Neil
Armstrong. Free to dream the beginning footsteps of my own future.
Free in mind and memory to meet others who also once dared to
dream, to go where everyone and no one has gone before. Free to
believe in today becoming a better tomorrow with the cover of every
book I open, opening those dreamland doors and setting my feet
inside... the outside, the</em> other <em>side, that resides inside
us all.</em></p>

<p><em>But ultimately, it is because of you, who put the books in
my hands, that I am set free to so dream.</em></p>

<p><em>Thank you!</em></p>

Normal</a></h2>

<p>For 15 years, we operated out of a room in the basement of
Foundry United Methodist Church, often having as many as 30
volunteers in the room in one evening. That came to an end in
March, when Foundry closed its building in response to the
pandemic. Foundry will reopen after the District of Columbia enters
Phase Three of its coronavirus recovery, and we anticipate
returning to Foundry at that time, but that may not happen until
well into 2021.</p>

<p>In order to continue providing service to prisoners while also
ensuring the safety of our volunteers, during the summer we
distributed our books and other supplies among makeshift sites that
each are used by only 1-2 volunteers. Thrifty volunteers found
creative solutions to the problem of our bookshelves still being in
Foundry's basement, repurposing old TV stands and tables. One
volunteer constructed these shelves out of cardboard boxes.</p>

<p>We continue to engage in a multi-step process to ensure that
each book package will comply with the rules of the prison it is
being sent to. Books are selected by one volunteer then handed off
to a second volunteer for quality control and packing. This usually
entails meeting outside, and has made us avid followers of weather
forecasts.</p>

<p>Other volunteers receive book donations from the public, sort
them by genre, and drive them to the sites where they are needed.
On one memorable occasion, heavy rain came down while volunteers
raced to transfer heavy boxes of books between cars.</p>

<p>Obtaining enough of the right kinds of books has been more
challenging during the pandemic, and we are grateful to donors who
have purchased books from our <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/XST0TQ95ZW67/">Amazon</a>
and <a href="https://www.politics-prose.com/wishlist/960">Politics
and Prose</a> wish lists or donated funds for purchasing books.</p>

<p>We are driven by the awareness that prisoners' need for books
has never been greater. Many of the prisoners requesting books from
us during the pandemic have commented on the extreme isolation they
are experiencing during the pandemic, saying that they have gone
nine months without access to libraries, classes, or religious
services. Books are now one of their few sources of entertainment
or spiritual sustenance.</p>

<p>Despite all of the challenges of sending books to prisoners
without access to our room in Foundry's basement, we are now
sending books at around the same rate we did before the pandemic.
Thank you to everyone who has made this possible.</p>

<h2>Card from Angel in Texas</h2>

<p>Prisoners often thank us for the books they receive from us by
sending us homemade cards. Making these cards is one of the few
outlets prisoners have for creativity, and in some cases the cards
are very elaborate. One prisoner sent us this extraordinary
card:</p>

<p><img

<p>Sadly, although prisoners can make and send cards like this, in
many cases they cannot receive cards from people on the outside.
Rules have been introduced in many prisons prohibiting all cards
except for those shipped directly from a handful of private
companies.</p>

<h2>Thank You</h2>

<p>Our work during this especially challenging year has been
possible only because of the support we've received from all of you
who have donated books, money, packing supplies, and time. The
value of your contributions is expressed well by this letter we
received from C. in North Carolina:</p>

<p><em>"Greetings and blessings... I thank you for making free
literature available to prisoners like me who don't have the
resources to buy a book... Friends, today more than ever in these
days of crisis and with the viral pandemic striking the nation, a
book helps us keep terror of this mortal virus out of our heads.
Also, a book is a perfect companion in a lonely cell... I have
learned that a book is a good friend that teaches, advises, and
guides you... Some people think that [a book] serves only to kill
time, but they aren't using their imagination to understand what
the book is trying to communicate. Others like the world of
literature and we embark on this great adventure with the help of
you who make it possible for us to have a book in our hands. Good
friends, many thanks!"</em></p>
