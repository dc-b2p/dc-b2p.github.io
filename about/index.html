    Founded in 1999, DC Books to Prisons provides free
              books to individual prisoners. We also develop and
              support prison libraries. Our work is done solely by
              concerned volunteers using donated time and resources.
              DC Books to Prisons is
              a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.

    Each year, we send more than
              7,000 book packages to
              prisoners in over 600 prisons in the United States.
              We serve state and federal prisoners in 34 states, and
              federal prisoners in Arizona. With the exception of DC
              residents in federal prisons, we do not serve inmates in
              CT, FL, IL, MA, ME, MI, NH, NJ, NY, OR, PA, RI, VT, WA, or WI.

     Why We Are Needed
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    The U.S. has less than five percent of the world's
              population, yet more than 25 percent of the world's
              prisoners. Nearly one percent of American adults are
              incarcerated; the highest rate in the world. However,
              many prisoners have little access to books or
              educational material. Usually, prisoners are not
              allowed to receive books from friends or family.
              While some prisons have libraries, many do not. Of
              prisons that do, access and selection can be
              extremely limited. Programs like ours are one of the
              few options available to prisoners seeking books.

    There are a number of similar projects throughout the
              country, so if you are looking to get involved but
