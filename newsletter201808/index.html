<h2>Improving Our Communication with You</h2>

<p>A great deal is happening at DC Books to Prisons (BtP), and we want to keep our volunteers
and supporters informed. We are going to do this in several ways:
</p>

<ul>
<li>This newsletter, which previously came out no more than four times per year, will now be 
published at least six times per year. (Not sure how you came to be subscribed? Please
contact us if you believe that someone else subscribed you without your consent, or use the
link at the end of the newsletter to unsubscribe.)
</li>

<li>We plan to increase our use of the prisonlit-announce mailing list, which will be used 
to announce opportunities of interest to our local volunteers and book donors. Not 
subscribed yet? You can subscribe by sending a blank e-mail message to 
<a href="mailto:prisonlit-announce-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">
prisonlit-announce-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a>. 
</li>

<li>We will continue to post to Twitter links to books-in-prisons news stories from around 
the world, plus updates on our activities, excerpts of letters from prisoners, and other 
items of interest. These can be read even if you aren't a Twitter user. Simply go to 
<a href="http://www.twitter.com/b2pdc">www.twitter.com/b2pdc</a> and scroll through our tweets.
</li>

<li>We also have a presence on Facebook, at 
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/DCBooksToPrisons/">www.facebook.com/DCBooksToPrisons/</a>
</li>

</ul>

<h2>Prison Book Restrictions</h2>

<p>Each prison system has rules on what books can be sent to prisoners, and who may send books.
Dedicated volunteers spend a great deal of time on the telephone to prison staff, determining
that one prison allows only softcover books, another allows only new books, another allows
only religious books, and so on.
</p>

<p>On several recent occasions, prison book restrictions have made the news. In New York, 
prison authorities started implementing a policy that 
<a href="https://thinkprogress.org/new-york-book-policy-83efefb676bc/">only an extremely 
small number of authorized vendors could send books</a>, and at one point fewer than 100 
titles were available from these vendors! After a public outcry, Governor Cuomo announced 
that the policy would be rescinded. A separate policy in New York restricted some 
prisoners from receiving books on the basis that they had access to televisions instead, 
and after the Village Voice drew attention to that policy, 
<a href="https://www.villagevoice.com/2018/02/23/prisoners-in-tv-facilities-can-now-receive-books/">
prisoners in so-called "TV" facilities were allowed to receive books</a>. </p>

<p>In both <a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/prisoners-rights/civil-liberties-prison/new-jersey-prisons-reverse-course-banning-new-jim-crow">
New Jersey</a> and <a href="https://www.acluofnorthcarolina.org/en/press-releases/north-carolina-prisons-lift-ban-new-jim-crow-following-aclu-letter">North Carolina</a>, state chapters of the ACLU requested that prisons in
their states lift bans on prisoners reading Michelle Alexander's book "The New Jim Crow", and
those bans were quickly overturned.
</p>

<p>In April, the government of Maryland implemented severe new restrictions on books for 
prisoners. One of the new rules prevented prisoners from obtaining books from groups like 
DC Books to Prisons or even online retailers like Amazon, instead restricting them to 
ordering books from two approved vendors. 
<a href="https://www.aclu-md.org/sites/default/files/field_documents/doc_book_letter_5_31_18.pdf">
The ACLU noted</a> that these vendors had such 
limited selections that prisoners would no longer be able to obtain, in the paperback 
format required by Maryland prisons, any of the Harry Potter books or any books by 
Langston Hughes or Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Our group was one of many that protested the 
new book restrictions. Eventually, in June, the new restrictions were lifted, and we 
resumed sending books to prisoners in Maryland. 
<a href="http://dcbookstoprisoners.org/maryland-book-ban/">More details about the situation in 
Maryland</a> are available on our web site.
</p>

<p>Not all news is good. Prison book programs, including BtP, have been blocked from sending 
books to state prisoners in Arizona.
</p>

<p>Another area of concern is the inability, in some locations, to determine which books are 
prohibited. 
<a href="https://www.arktimes.com/ArkansasBlog/archives/2017/12/14/wondering-what-books-are-banned-in-arkansass-prisons-its-confidential">
Journalist Jacob Rosenberg of the Arkansas Times has used Freedom of Information 
requests</a> in an attempt to learn which books are prohibited in his state, without success.
</p>

<p>We will continue to follow these stories, and will let you know of major developments.
</p>


<h2>Letter from Inmate</h2>

<p><em>Thank you very much for sending the two titles:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Master and Commander<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-	Colgate's Basic Sailing
</p>

<p>I love them both! I've known of Patrick O'Brian's books for a while but completely forgot 
about them. Now I must read them all! Oh, how I long to be a sailor on a 250 year old tall 
ship! What an exciting life it must have been. Sometimes when I'm daydreaming, I imagine 
that I'm not a prisoner but a pressganged sailor on a giant ship. Sometimes, the ship is 
an enormous hulking spaceship from Warhammer 40K. :-) The wild sleep and slave assignment 
schedules make it easy to dream up such alternate realities. And it sure beats the 
dreariness of actual prison. The creative mind cannot be confined!
</p>

<p>... Thank you for your hard work. Thank you for your effort. Time. Monies. Thank you for 
TWICE choosing material that spurred my intellect and imagination and freeing me, if but 
mentally and momentarily, from my awful conditions. May your sails be always full, my 
friends!</em>
</p>


<h2>Freeing Children's Minds: 2,000 Libros</h2>

<p>Although most of our work involves sending books to adult prisoners, there are times when 
we provide books to children. Regular readers of this newsletter will recall that we 
provide children's books and magazines to the visiting and waiting rooms of prisons 
operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). Children with incarcerated family members 
enjoy these materials while visiting their parents.
</p>

<p>On Independence Day, with freedom very much on the mind, we announced our support of
2,000 Libros, a project to free the minds of the country's youngest prisoners: immigrant
children in detention centers. While taking no position on immigration policy in general,
we believe that children detained due to their immigration status should have access to
books, just as we believe that adults imprisoned due to criminal convictions should have
access to books.
</p>

<p>So far, 2,000 Libros has sent more than 1,300 Spanish-language and English/Spanish 
bilingual children's and young-adult books to detention centers around the country. Local 
book stores assisted greatly by serving as drop-off locations for these books during July. 
A store in Arlington, Virginia, <a href="http://www.onemorepagebooks.com/">One More Page 
Books</a>, even matched donations! We are grateful to <a 
href="http://www.onemorepagebooks.com/">One More Page Books</a>, <a 
href="https://www.politics-prose.com/">Politics and Prose</a>, <a 
href="http://www.eastcitybookshop.com/">East City Bookshop</a>, and <a 
href="https://www.busboysandpoets.com/">Busboys and Poets</a> for their assistance. We are 
also very grateful to the many members of the public who donated books. Although the book 
drives in DC-area book stores are now over, we continue to receive books locally via three 
online wish lists. Also, in August, we started collecting books in New York City, and 
volunteers across the country are working to establish collection points in their own 
hometowns.</p>

<p>At the time 2,000 Libros was started, the focus was on getting books into the hands of
children who had been separated from their parents or other caregivers at the border.
Now that most of those children have been returned to their parents, the focus is shifting
to providing books to children (mostly teens) who reached the border unaccompanied.
</p>

<p><a href="http://dcbookstoprisoners.org/libros/">More information about 2,000 Libros</a> 
can be seen on our web site, including links to news 
articles about the project. Most articles were written by U.S. media, but there are also 
articles published in France and Peru! In addition to news articles, the web site has links
to the three online wish lists.
</p>

<p>DC Books to Prisons will continue to focus on serving adults in state and federal
prisons, while also supporting this important initiative to serve our nation's youngest
prisoners.
</p>

<h2>Thank You</h2>

<p>We are grateful to the many, many people and organizations who have donated books to us.
Among them are:

<ul>

<li>Marlin at <a href="https://www.sidwell.edu/">Sidwell Friends School</a>, who donated 
many boxes of well-chosen books.</li>

<li>Kathleen, who regularly brings in Spanish-language books in popular genres like science 
fiction.</li>

<li>Authors <a href="https://angelhornpages.wordpress.com/">
G.S. Prendergast</a> and <a href="https://www.jamesformanjr.com/">James Forman Jr.</a>, 
who donated copies of books they had written.</li>

<li><a href="http://turningthepage.org/carpe-librum-expansions/">Carpe Librum</a>, 
which donated many books to us, including much-needed paperback fantasy novels.</li>

<li><img src="stjohns-dictionaries-koontz-patterson.jpg" align=right 
alt="[photo of stacks of pristine dictionaries, Koontz 
novels, and Patterson novels, donated by parishioners at St. John's Episcopal Church, 
Norwood Parish]">
Groups that have held book drives for us, including 
<a href="https://stjohnsnorwood.org/">St. John's Episcopal Church, Norwood 
Parish</a>; <a href="https://makeoffices.com/locations/washington-dc/logan-exchange/">
Logan Exchange</a>, which also generously provided us with storage space; and 
<a href="https://www.arnoldporter.com/en/offices/washington-dc">Arnold 
&amp; Porter</a>.</li>

<li>Groups that have allowed us to sort through and take hundreds of books left over at the 
end of their book sales, including <a href="http://www.folcalvert.org/">
Friends of the Calvert County Library</a>, the 
<a href="http://www.bccptsa.net/">Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School PTSA</a>, the 
<a href="https://gaithersburg-md.aauw.net/">Gaithersburg branch of AAUW</a>, the 
<a href="https://www.jlw.org/">Junior League of 
Washington</a>, and <a href="https://nationalchurch.org/umw/">Metropolitan United 
Methodist Women</a>. In two cases, we were allowed to 
take so many books that we filled an entire car!
</li>

<li><a href="http://awidercircle.org/">A Wider Circle</a>, 
<a href="http://augustanadc.org/">Augustana Lutheran Church</a>, and
<a href="http://www.alfredstreet.org/">Alfred Street Baptist Church (Library)</a>,
all of which donated books.
</li>

</ul>
</p>

<p>Most of the prisoners we serve are located far from us, so money must be spent mailing the
books to them. We are very grateful to everyone who has contributed to our fundraising efforts.
Among them are:
<ul>
<li>Michele, who planned an online fundraising campaign, and all the generous people who
gave in response to it.</li>

<li>Alexis of the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/humorlessqueers">Humorless Queers 
podcast</a>, who amplified the fundraising campaign and asked her Twitter followers to 
give to us. This generated an extraordinary response, and we are grateful to each 
individual who donated.</li>

<li>Lori, who planned the "Postage Hike" fundraiser, and everyone who participated in it. 
This event consisted of a hike through Rock Creek Park, a trip to a book store, and a 
bagel lunch.</li>

<li>Local musicians and bands <a href="https://herschelhoover.bandcamp.com/">Herschel 
Hoover</a>, <a href="https://barkingcarnies.bandcamp.com/">Barking Carnies</a>, <a 
href="https://chillparents.bandcamp.com/">Chill Parents</a>, and Trigger Warning, who 
played a benefit show for BtP. We especially thank Herschel Hoover, who rented the space, 
and volunteers Jason and Andy. Andy is best known at BtP for handling challenging book 
requests, but at the benefit show he instead handled drum sticks in his role as Chill 
Parents' drummer. [photo of Chill Parents]</li>

<li><a href="https://www.politics-prose.com/">Politics and Prose</a>'s Connecticut 
Avenue store, which allowed us to table at the store
on June 1 and then donated to us a portion of that day's sales.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>We are also very grateful to all the generous people who have made individual donations. 
Recently, three generous people each gave multiple sheets of postage stamps, and their 
collective generosity has allowed over one hundred prisoners to receive packages of books 
in the mail. Many other individuals made monetary donations.
</p>
