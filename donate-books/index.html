     We appreciate your donation of books.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 14.4px; line-height: 23.04px;">
     Most book donors give us
              books from their personal collections. If you prefer to purchase books
              to donate, please check out our
     <a href="https://www.politics-prose.com/wishlist/960">

    <p style="font-size: 14.4px; line-height: 23.04px;">
     Please donate only GOOD-CONDITION
     <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">PAPERBACK BOOKS</span></strong>
     in either Spanish or
              English. (Many prisons reject hardback
              books, and all reject books that are water-damaged, stained, or moldy.)
              Books should not contain excessive underlining or margin notes. Our list
              of
     <strong>Greatest Book
              Needs</strong>
     includes the books most often
              requested. Outdated resources, (e.g., computer
              manuals), are not needed. We no longer carry law books,
              although paperback legal dictionaries are welcome.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 14.4px; line-height: 23.04px;">
     Please consider bundling series of books, remove any
              personal information (including your name and
              address), and make sure you check books for photos,
              letters, or other personal items you might not want
              to share with prisoners.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 14.4px; line-height: 23.04px;">
     Most of our books are donated directly by individuals, but
              we also receive donations as a result of book drives.
              Please email us at btopdc(at)gmail.com
              before hosting a book drive so we can
              let you know our storage capabilities and the genres
              we are currently set on.

    <p id="dropping-off">
     1. <u>Dropping off books</u>:
    </p>
    <p>
     Books may be dropped off Wednesday evenings 6-8pm in our room in
the basement of Foundry United Methodist Church. The church is at
1500 16th Street NW, Washington DC 20036. If you drive, please
be aware Foundry does not have visitor parking, so you will need to
find street parking.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>Please do NOT leave books on the floor outside our
room!</strong>
     Any books left there will be taken to a recycling
bin by the church janitor. Always leave books with a volunteer.
Donors are asked to bring no more than two boxes or bags of books
per week. If you wish to donate a greater quantity, please contact
btopdc(at)gmail.com to make arrangements.
    </p>
    <p>
     In compliance with Foundry's mask policy, people dropping
off books must wear masks that cover both their mouths
     <strong>and
noses</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
     A note to people who, in the days before the pandemic, brought
books for donation and then stayed to volunteer: Unfortunately, we
are not able to accommodate drop-in volunteers at this time.
    </p>
    <p>
     2. <u>Mail</u>: Please do not mail books to us &ndash; BtP
              maintains a PO Box and we lack the resources
              to receive or transport mailed books.
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      Please mail books directly to a prison librarian
              instead.
     </li>
     <li>
      For a list of prison librarians
              accepting books, contact btopdc(at)gmail.com with
              "Prison Library List" in the subject line.
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     We reserve the
              right to give away or trade any books that might
              not be needed by prisoners. If you have books to donate
              that you are certain we cannot use, a place in Washington
              DC where they can be
              donated is Carpe Librum at 1220 19th Street NW.
