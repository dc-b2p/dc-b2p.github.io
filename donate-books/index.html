<p>We appreciate your donation of books.</p>

<p>Most book donors give us books from their personal collections. If
you prefer to purchase books to donate, please check out
our <a href="https://politics-prose.com/wishlist/rocliswawresp"><strong>Politics and
Prose wish list</strong></a>,

<p>Please donate only GOOD-CONDITION <strong><span
style="color:#ff0000;">PAPERBACK BOOKS</span></strong> in either
Spanish or English. (Many prisons reject hardback books, and all
reject books that are water-damaged, stained, or moldy.) Books should
not contain excessive underlining or margin notes. Our list
of <strong>Greatest Book Needs</strong> includes the books most often
requested. Outdated resources, (e.g., computer manuals), are not
needed. We no longer carry law books, although paperback legal
dictionaries are welcome.</p>

<p>Please consider bundling series of books, remove any personal
information (including your name and address), and make sure you check
books for photos, letters, or other personal items you might not want
to share with incarcerated people.</p>

<p>Most of our books are donated directly by individuals, but we also
receive donations as a result of book drives. Please email us at
btopdc(at)gmail.com before hosting a book drive so we can let you know
our storage capabilities and the genres we are currently set on.</p>

<p id="dropping-off">1. <u>Dropping off books</u>:</p>

<p>Books may be dropped off Wednesday evenings 6-8pm in our room in
the basement of Foundry United Methodist Church. The church is at
1500 16th Street NW, Washington DC 20036. If you drive, please be
aware Foundry does not have visitor parking, so you will need to
find street parking.</p>

<p><strong>Please do NOT leave books on the floor outside our
room!</strong> Any books left there will be taken to a recycling
bin by the church janitor. Always leave books with a volunteer.
Donors are asked to bring no more than two boxes or bags of books
per week. If you wish to donate a greater quantity, please contact
btopdc(at)gmail.com to make arrangements.</p>

<p>We ask that people dropping off books wear masks that cover 
both their mouths <strong>and noses</strong>.</p>

<p>A note to people who, in the days before the pandemic, brought
books for donation and then stayed to volunteer: Unfortunately, we
are not able to accommodate drop-in volunteers at this time.</p>

<p>2. <u>Mail</u>: Please do not mail books to us &mdash; BtP maintains a
PO Box and we lack the resources to receive or transport mailed
books.</p>

<ul>
<li>Please mail books directly to a prison librarian instead.</li>
<li>For a list of prison librarians accepting books, contact
    btopdc(at)gmail.com with "Prison Library List" in the subject
    line.</li>
</ul>

<p>We reserve the right to give away or trade any books that
might not be needed by people in prison. If you have books to donate
that you are certain we cannot use, please consider donating to
<a href="https://turningthepage.org/get-involved/donate/book-donations/">Turning
the Page</a>
or a local library that 
holds book sales.
