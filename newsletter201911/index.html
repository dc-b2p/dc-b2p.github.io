<h2>Incarcerated Student Obtains GED</h2>

<p>We were delighted to receive this letter in the mail from Logan,
who is incarcerated in Kenedy, Texas:</p>

<p><em>"Thanks to your [program], I was able to get my GED. I want
to give all your staff a big shoutout and thank you! Because of
y'all sending me a couple study guides and GED testing books, I now
have completed the GED test and got my diploma. Thanks for
everything. God bless."</em></p>

<p>The GED preparation book we had sent to Logan had been donated
by someone who knew of the need for it as a result of browsing our <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1NBVRRZGMJX3Q?">Amazon Wish
List</a>. We are immensely grateful to the donor, and know that
Logan is too!</p>

<h2>Creative Fundraisers Allow Books to Travel the Country</h2>

<p>Donated books wouldn't do prisoners any good if they sat in our
room in Washington, DC. In order to mail over 6,000 packages of
books to prisoners each year, we need money to pay USPS for
shipping. Fortunately, we are blessed to have many supporters who
donate postage funds. Some donate directly, while others hold
creative fundraisers. In this newsletter, we are highlighting some
of the fundraisers that have enabled us to mail thousands of book
packages.</p>

<h3>Fall Fest at Oliver Fire Protection &amp; Security</h3>

<p>Every year, <a href="https://oliverfps.com/">Oliver Fire
Protection &amp; Security</a>, a company based in King of Prussia,
Pennsylvania, holds a month of fundraising activities and donates
the proceeds to charity. We were honored to be chosen as the
beneficiary for 2018. Employees paid to participate in a variety of
activities, and at the end of the month attended a fun-filled Fall
Fest. The light-hearted competitions at the Fall Fest included one
in which participants had to eat donuts hanging from strings (see
photo below).</p>

<p>Oliver Fire Protection &amp; Security also held a book drive for
us, resulting in seven boxes of carefully-chosen books. Especially
appreciated were some role-playing game (RPG) books, which are in
very high demand in prisons. (Participating in RPGs provides
prisoners with social interaction, and has been noted to be one of
the few activities in men's prisons that is often racially
integrated.)</p>

<p>We are very grateful to Oliver Fire Protection &amp; Security
for its generosity to us and the prisoners we serve!</p>
<h3>Cupcakes</h3>

<p>Another fun fundraiser was the one held for us by <a
href="http://www.stickyfingersbakery.com">Sticky Fingers Sweets &amp;
Eats</a>, a bakery and cafe in the Columbia Heights neighborhood of
Washington, DC. As Sticky Fingers' Charity of the Month for April
2019, we received $1 for each almond creme cupcake sold that
month.</p>

<p>Cupcakes and other baked goods were also sold in an unrelated
bake sale held at <a href="http://foundryumc.org/">Foundry United
Methodist Church</a> in May. Our volunteers did the baking for this
annual event, and church members flocked to purchase delicious
treats.</p>
<h3>Tabling at Politics and Prose Bookstore</h3>

<p>One day each year, the Connecticut Avenue location of <a
href="https://www.politics-prose.com/">Politics and Prose</a> allows
us to table in their store, allowing us to meet lots of book lovers
and talk to them about the books we need (many of which are sold at
the store). Additionally, if customers mention us at the cash
register on that day, we receive 20% of the sale!</p>
<h3>Readathons</h3>

<p>In April, our volunteer Amanda shared with us the wonderful news
that she had held a readathon, soliciting donations from her
Facebook followers for each page read. Showing amazing dedication
to BtP, she read for 24 hours, and kept her followers informed of
her progress with frequent updates.</p>

<p>In September, a local alternative religious group also held a
readathon. Dubbed "Lucre for Literacy", it attracted participants
from as far away as Philadelphia. A whopping 1,036 pages were read,
and a check was sent to us along with a beautiful card affirming
the value of books.</p>

<h2>We've Moved!</h2>

<p>Our program could not operate without space generously provided
to us by <a href="http://foundryumc.org/">Foundry United Methodist
Church</a>. Foundry recently moved us from the room we had been
operating in for many years to another room on the same floor.
Supporters who wish to stop by with book donations can now find us
in room B1. We are immensely grateful to Foundry for continuing to
host our volunteers and books!</p>

<h2>Updates</h2>

<h3>Book Restrictions</h3>

<p>In a previous newsletter, we described severe restrictions on
books for prisoners in several states. <a
href="https://www.inquirer.com/philly/news/pennsylvania-book-ban-doc-books-through-bars-wetzel-20181102.html">For
prisoners in Pennsylvania, there is partial good news.</a>
Prison book programs can now send books to a central facility, and
in theory all books are then sent on to their intended recipients.
However, there are reports of some book packages being
rejected.</p>

<p>Numerous organizations are now taking an interest in prison book
restrictions. One of the most prominent is PEN America, which
recently launched a campaign called <a
href="https://www.pen.org/banned-books-2019">Literature Locked Up</a>
that seeks to end book bans in prisons. As part of the campaign,
PEN publicized <a
href="https://www.pen.org/literature-locked-up-banned-books-2019">a few
examples of books banned in prisons</a>.</p>

<p>News outlets are also talking about prison book restrictions.
One of our volunteers, Jackie, was recently quoted in <a
href="https://bookriot.com/2019/10/21/censorship-in-american-prisons/">a
Book Riot article about censorship in prisons</a>.</p>
<h3>2,000 Libros</h3>

<p>When we first wrote about 2,000 Libros, the project had just
begun, with a goal of sending 2,000 books ("libros" in Spanish) to
children in immigration detention facilities. At the time, around
2,000 children had recently been torn from their families and
placed in detention, and the goal was to send one book per
child.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that the project succeeded in
acquiring and shipping 2,000 books! These books provided comfort to
children at a time when they most needed it, and also helped with
improving literacy and fostering a love of reading.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, in the time it took to send 2,000 books, more
children were detained and became in need of books. The project
continues to collect books to send to children in detention,
primarily Spanish and bilingual books.</p>

<p>Recent donors have included:</p>

<ul>
<li>Chronicle Books (105 books)</li>
<li>Mara Wilson (75 copies of Matilda)</li>
<li>Shout Mouse Press (237 copies of Voces Sin Fronteras)</li>
<li>Lufi and Friends (10 song books)</li>
<li>Kendra Hyett (109 books, including Harry Potter books in
    Spanish)</li>
<li>The American Psychological Association and Magination Press
    (400 Spanish-language workbooks geared toward helping kids work
    through issues with anxiety and worry)</li>
</ul>

<p>Many other people have donated smaller quantities of books, most
of them through wish lists at <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/registry/wishlist/YE7CDP3XCWFX">Amazon</a>
and local bookstores. We are grateful to all donors, past and
future, for their support of this initiative to support detained
children.</p>

<h2>Letter from an Incarcerated Reader</h2>

<p>We end this newsletter as we began it, with a letter from an
incarcerated reader. This letter came from Marc, who requested
manga, RPG books, and sci-fi and fantasy novels:</p>

<p><em>"Thank you guys for helping us out, and taking time out of
your lives to help keep us going. Your services are appreciated
infinity times over. There are a lot of people nowadays that the
only stuff they can get in is from donations and the hard-working
people behind the donations. :-) Thank you again from me and many
others."</em></p>
