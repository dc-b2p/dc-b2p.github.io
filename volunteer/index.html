<p><em>[Last updated: December 2, 2022]</em></p>

<p>Thank you for your interest in volunteering with us! As an
all-volunteer group, our work is possible only because of the
dedication of volunteers.</p>

<p>We are currently open again for new volunteer training. All
first-time volunteers must attend orientation. To attend,
please email btopdc(at)gmail.com to be added to our
orientation waitlist. Those on the waitlist will be notified 
via email when new orientation times are scheduled.</p>

<p>Volunteers must be vaccinated and 
wear a mask while in our
workspace, and <strong>must sign up
in advance for the hour(s) during which they will
volunteer</strong>. Full details and a link to the sign-up sheet
will be provided after orientation. Returning volunteers
should reach out to btopdc(at)gmail.com to
receive access to the sign up sheet and be briefed on 
any new workspace rules.
</p>

<h2>Community Service</h2>

<p>If you need documentation of community service hours, you must
have your arrival and departure times logged each time you
volunteer. Ask for an Engaged Volunteer to
record the times of your arrival and departure. We cannot certify
community service hours if this procedure is not followed.
New volunteers who need community service hours must complete 
orientation.</p>

<h2>When and Where We Pack</h2>

<p>Please note that our building closes on all federal holidays 
and whenever
snow causes the federal government to close.

<p>To get to us via Metro, take the Red Line to Dupont Circle,
leave via the south entrance, walk partially around the circle to P
Street, and go east 2.5 blocks.</p>

<p>To get to us via the Blue/Orange Line, go to McPherson Square,
leave via the White House exit, walk one block west on I Street.
Once you get to 16th Street, wait for a northbound bus. When the
bus goes through the tunnel, pull the "stop requested" wire and get
off at the next stop which is the intersection of P Street and 16th
Street NW.</p>

<p>If you travel via <a href="http://www.capitalbikeshare.com">Capital
Bikeshare</a>, you can dock your bike at station #31201, located at the
intersection of P Street NW and 15th Street NW.</p>

<p>If you are driving, please be aware Foundry does not have a
parking lot for visitors, so you will need to find street
parking.</p>

<p>The church has multiple entrances. Use the one on 16th Street
that can be reached by going up either steps or a ramp. Ring the
doorbell to be let in, go through the lobby to your left, then go
downstairs. At the bottom of the stairs, turn left. We are in room
B1, opposite the men's restroom.</p>

<p>Volunteers using wheelchairs or scooters can reach our room by
going up the ramp on 16th Street then taking an elevator down to
our floor. The accessible route to our room involves heavy doors
that are sometimes locked, so we strongly advise that you ask the
receptionist to escort you. For more details on disability access,
see our page for <a

disabilities</a>.</p>

<h2>Nut-Free Policy</h2>

<p>To ensure the safety of a person with a severe nut allergy,
Foundry has gone nut-free. Please do not bring any foods containing
nuts into the building.</p>
