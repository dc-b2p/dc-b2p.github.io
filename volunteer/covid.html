<h1 id="page-title">Volunteering During the Pandemic</h1>

<div class="content clear-block">

<p><em>[Last updated: February 1, 2022]</em></p>

<p>The pandemic has forced us to make frequent changes to our
procedures, and we anticipate making further changes as the
pandemic progresses.</p>

<p>At this time, the only volunteers we can accommodate are those
who completed orientation and started volunteering with us prior to
the pandemic. If you have not been oriented yet, please continue to
check this page or our home page to learn when we are able to
accept new volunteers again.</p>

<p>We currently allow only five volunteers in our workspace at a
time. <strong>Volunteers must be vaccinated and must sign up in
advance using <a
href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QuY7rZP1nup31qH1XtMAsSQws1PpHnU6_8oUD2Gh3RU/edit?usp=sharing">this
sign-up sheet</a>.</strong> Signing up is done on a first-come,
first-served basis. If there is a spot in yellow that is open, you
can put your name there to sign up.</p>

<h2>Safety</h2>

<ul>
<li>Volunteers who want to work in our room in the basement of
    Foundry United Methodist Church will need to bring their vaccine
    card or a photo of their vaccine card to show to the volunteer in
    charge at the beginning of each shift.</li>
<li>All volunteers will need to wear a mask the entire time they're
    in the room (see below for mask requirements). No eating or
    drinking will be allowed in the room.</li>
<li>We have invested in some masks (although we encourage you to
    bring your own) and some cleaning supplies as well as an air
    purifier.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mask Requirements</h2>

<p>We are using the guidance from the CDC: <a
href="https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/masks/mask-travel-guidance.html">https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/masks/mask-travel-guidance.html</a></p>

<p>The following are attributes of acceptable masks:</p>

<ul>
<li>A properly worn mask completely covers the nose and mouth.</li>
<li>Cloth masks should be made with two or more layers of a
    breathable fabric that is tightly woven (i.e., fabrics that do not
    let light pass through when held up to a light source).</li>
<li>Mask should be secured to the head with ties, ear loops, or
    elastic bands that go behind the head. If gaiters are worn, they
    should have two layers of fabric or be folded to make two
    layers.</li>
<li>Mask should fit snugly but comfortably against the side of the
    face.</li>
<li>Mask should be a solid piece of material without slits,
    exhalation valves, or punctures.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following attributes are additionally acceptable as long as
masks meet the requirements above.</p>

<ul>
<li>Masks can be either manufactured or homemade.</li>
<li>Masks can be reusable or disposable.</li>
<li>Masks can have inner filter pockets.</li>
<li>Clear masks or cloth masks with a clear plastic panel may be
    used to facilitate communication with people who are hearing
    impaired or others who need to see a speaker's mouth to understand
    speech.</li>
<li>Medical masks and N-95 respirators are good.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following do not fulfill the requirements of acceptable
masks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Masks worn in a way that does not cover both the mouth and
    nose</li>
<li>Face shields or goggles (face shields or goggles may be worn to
    supplement a mask that meets above required attributes)</li>
<li>Scarves, ski masks, balaclavas, or bandannas</li>
<li>Shirt or sweater collars (e.g., turtleneck collars) pulled up
    over the mouth and nose</li>
<li>Masks made from loosely woven fabric or that are knitted, i.e.,
    fabrics that let light pass through</li>
<li>Masks made from materials that are hard to breathe through
    (such as vinyl, plastic or leather)</li>
<li>Masks containing slits, exhalation valves, or punctures</li>
<li>Masks that do not fit properly (large gaps, too loose or too
    tight)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Non-Covid Health Reminders</h2>

<p>Covid-19 isn't the only health concern of people in the
building. Please be reminded of the following, which could save
someone's life:</p>

<ul>
<li>To ensure the safety of a person with a severe nut allergy,
    <strong>Foundry prohibits nuts of all kinds</strong> throughout
    the building. Please do not bring any foods containing nuts into
    the building.</li>
<li><strong>Foundry has an AED</strong> for use on heart attack
    victims. If a 911 operator instructs you to use it, here's how to
    get to it: Go up one floor via the main stairs, then keep walking
    straight ahead towards the smaller of Foundry's two elevators. Just
    before you reach the elevator door, you will see the AED on your
    right. Note: The elevator no longer works, so you will need to use
    the stairs to reach the AED and return to our room. If you have
    concerns about helping a heart attack victim whose coronavirus
    status is unknown, see <strong><a
    href="https://www.redcross.org/take-a-class/coronavirus-information/first-aid-cpr-aed-care-during-covid-19">the
    Red Cross's guidance on performing CPR and using AEDs during
    the pandemic</a></strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you for your attention to health and safety. We look
forward to having you volunteer with us!</p>
