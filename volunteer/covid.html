            <p><em>[Last updated: February 1, 2022]</em>
            </p>

            <p>
              The pandemic has forced us to make frequent changes to our
              procedures, and we anticipate making further changes as
              the pandemic progresses.
            </p>

            <p>
              At this time, the only volunteers we can accommodate
              are those who completed orientation and
              started volunteering with us prior to the pandemic.
              If you have not been oriented yet, please continue
              to check this page or our home page to learn when we
              are able to accept new volunteers again.
            </p>

            <p>
              We currently allow only five volunteers in our workspace
              at a time. <strong>Volunteers must be vaccinated and
              must sign up in advance using
              <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QuY7rZP1nup31qH1XtMAsSQws1PpHnU6_8oUD2Gh3RU/edit?usp=sharing">this
              sign-up sheet</a>.</strong> Signing up is done on a
              first-come,
              first-served basis. If there is a spot in yellow that is
              open, you can put your name there to sign up.
            </p>

<h2>Safety</h2>

            <li>
              Volunteers who want to work in our room in the basement
              of Foundry United Methodist Church will need to bring
              their vaccine card or a photo of their vaccine card to show
              to the volunteer in charge
              at the beginning of each shift.
            </li>
            <li>
              All volunteers will need to wear a mask the entire time
              they're in the room (see below for mask requirements).
              No eating or drinking will be allowed in the room.
            </li>
            <li>
              We have invested in some masks (although we encourage
              you to bring your own)
              and some cleaning supplies as well as an air purifier.
            </li>

<h2>Mask Requirements</h2>

            <p>
              We are using the guidance from the CDC:
              <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/masks/mask-travel-guidance.html">https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/masks/mask-travel-guidance.html</a>
            </p>
            <p>
              The following are attributes of acceptable masks:
<ul>

<li>A properly worn mask completely covers the nose and mouth.</li>

<li>Cloth masks should be made with two or more layers of a breathable
fabric that is tightly woven (i.e., fabrics that do not let light pass
through when held up to a light source).</li>

<li>Mask should be secured to the head with ties, ear loops, or elastic
bands that go behind the head. If gaiters are worn, they should have two
layers of fabric or be folded to make two layers.</li>

<li>Mask should fit snugly but comfortably against the side of
the face.</li>

<li>Mask should be a solid piece of material without slits, exhalation
valves, or punctures.</li>

</ul>
            </p>

<p>The following attributes are additionally acceptable as long as masks meet
the requirements above.

<ul>

<li>Masks can be either manufactured or homemade.</li>

<li>Masks can be reusable or disposable.</li>

<li>Masks can have inner filter pockets.</li>

<li>Clear masks or cloth masks with a clear plastic panel may be used to
facilitate communication with people who are hearing impaired or others
who need to see a speaker's mouth to understand speech.</li>

<li>Medical masks and N-95 respirators are good.</li>

</ul>
</p>


<p>The following do not fulfill the requirements of acceptable masks:

<ul>

<li>Masks worn in a way that does not cover both the mouth and nose</li>

<li>Face shields or goggles (face shields or goggles may be worn to
supplement a mask that meets above required attributes)</li>

<li>Scarves, ski masks, balaclavas, or bandannas</li>

<li>Shirt or sweater collars (e.g., turtleneck collars) pulled up
over the mouth and nose</li>

<li>Masks made from loosely woven fabric or that are knitted, i.e., fabrics
that let light pass through</li>

<li>Masks made from materials that are hard to breathe through (such as
vinyl, plastic or leather)</li>

<li>Masks containing slits, exhalation valves, or punctures</li>

<li>Masks that do not fit properly (large gaps, too loose
or too tight)</li>

</ul>

</p>



<h2>Non-Covid Health Reminders</h2>

            <p>
              Covid-19 isn't the only health concern
              of people in the building. Please be reminded of
              the following, which could save someone's life:
              <ul>
              <li> To ensure the safety of a
              person with a severe nut allergy, <strong>Foundry
              prohibits nuts of all kinds</strong> throughout the building.
              Please do not bring any foods containing nuts into the
              building.</li>
              <li><strong>Foundry has an AED</strong> for use
              on heart attack victims.
              If a 911 operator instructs you to use it, here's how to
              get to it: Go up one floor via the main stairs, then
              keep walking straight ahead towards the smaller of
              Foundry's two elevators. Just before you reach the
              elevator door, you will
              see the AED on your right. Note: The elevator no
              longer works, so you will need to use the
              stairs to reach the AED and return to our room.
              If you have concerns about helping a heart attack
              victim whose coronavirus status is unknown, see
              <a href="https://www.redcross.org/take-a-class/coronavirus-information/first-aid-cpr-aed-care-during-covid-19"><strong>the
              Red Cross's guidance
              on performing CPR and using AEDs during the pandemic</strong></a>.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

<p>Thank you for your attention to health and safety. We look
forward to having you volunteer with us!
