<p>Recent lists of banned books for some states can be obtained from 
<a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2022/12/21/prison-banned-books-list-find-your-state">The
Marshall Project</a>. Scroll down to the line that says "Which 
books are banned in [state name] prisons?" and select the state you want.
Most lists appear to have been obtained in 2022.</p>

<p>Older lists, mostly dating to around 2019, can be obtained from
two sources: 

<a href="http://www.bookstoprisoners.net/banned-book-lists/">Seattle's
prison book program</a> and <a
href="https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/publications/tag/banned-book-lists/">the 
Human Rights Defense Center</a>.</p>

<p>All of these lists are long, and can cause older smartphones
and computers to choke. If you are capable of viewing only a short
list, see the <a href="banned-texas-short.html">short              
list of popular books banned in Texas</a> that was produced in 2019.</p>
