<h2>First-Class Mail</h2>

<p>According to one post office, all rates remain the same as in
2019. That post office told us that standard envelopes weighing up
to 1 ounce cost 55 cents, large envelopes weighing up to 1 ounce
cost $1, additional ounces on both standard and large envelopes
cost 15 cents, and postcards cost 35 cents. We have successfully
mailed many large envelopes at that post office using that
information. <strong>However, the information on the cost for
additional ounces on large envelopes is contradicted by USPS's
postage calculator and a second post office.</strong> The only
possible interpretation of the rates shown by the <a
href="https://www.usps.com/nationalpremieraccounts/calculaterates.htm">postage
calculator</a> is that large envelopes cost $1 for the first ounce
then <strong>20 cents</strong> (not 15 cents) for each additional
ounce. According to the postage calculator, the costs for large
envelopes are:</p>

<p>Note: This means that any large envelope weighing more than 10
ounces would be cheaper to send by Media Mail than by First-Class
Mail. (Unfortunately, many large envelopes are ineligible for being
mailed this way, but a few are eligible for being sent by either
method.)</p>
