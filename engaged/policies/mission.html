    To provide a wide variety of informative, educational and enjoyable reading material, free of
charge, to inmates in US prisons. We prioritize inmates in underserved regions and respond to
individual inmates' requests, whenever possible including short personal notes (which are
sometimes as important as the books we send). Efforts include selected secondary projects to
address the gap in resources and access to reading material. We believe that books can
change lives. They can change the way people view the world, other people, and themselves,
provide an education, provide a vocabulary, and open minds to new possibilities.
