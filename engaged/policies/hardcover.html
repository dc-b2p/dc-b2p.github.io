    When communicating with book donors, it is usually best to say "We
seek
    <strong>
     <em>
      paperback
     </em>
    </strong>
    books in the following
categories..." and keep emphasizing that "paperback" books are the only
ones we seek.
   </p>
   <p>
    However, under certain circumstances, we
    <strong>
     do
    </strong>
    accept
hardcover books. The following list of hardcover books we
accept is intended for volunteers who sort or shelve
books. The information will also be useful for volunteers who are
explicitly asked by book donors whether we will accept specific
hardcover books they wish to donate. (Please do not send donors a link
to this page, since the page links to other pages not intended
for the general public to see. Instead, refer to the list yourself and
answer donors' questions accordingly.)
   </p>
   <p>
    The list will be amended as needed in response to changes in our
inventory.
   </p>
   <p>
    We accept:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     Popular fantasy and sci-fi novels, e.g. any of the Harry Potter books -
show these to Megan instead of shelving them
    </li>
    <li>
     Popular books (not classics) in Spanish - show these to Jen instead of
shelving them
    </li>
    <li>
     How-to-draw books, if 100% free of nudity
    </li>
    <li>
     English dictionaries - must be in fairly good condition, have a
copyright year of 1980 or later, and not contain more than 2,000 pages
     <em>
      (see below for explanation)
     </em>
    </li>
    <li>
     Books that will be sent to prison book clubs
    </li>
    <li>
     Study Bibles (
     <strong>
      not
     </strong>
     regular Bibles, which we're
usually drowning in)
    </li>
    <li>
     Books for learning a trade
    </li>
    <li>
     Role-playing game books
    </li>
    <li>
     Joke books
    </li>
    <li>
     Manga
    </li>
    <li>
     Any other genres in which we currently have a critical shortage. This
is obviously a very vague category, but may include books like
Arabic-English dictionaries.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    <strong>
     An explanation of the criteria for hardcover
dictionaries:
    </strong>
    The simplest criterion is that dictionaries
should be in fairly good condition (not falling apart), in order to
maximize the number of prisons that will accept them. We also want them
to be reasonably recent so that they will contain all the words
prisoners seek definitions for. "Reasonably recent" is too subjective a
standard to be useful, so we picked 1980 as the cutoff year. We also
wanted to implement a size limit, eliminating the truly enormous
dictionaries that are sometimes donated, but "truly enormous" is another
very subjective term. Ideally, we would state a weight limit, but those
are of little use when communicating with donors who don't have a scale
handy. An examination of big hardcover books revealed that limiting
pages to around 2,000 would allow us to send all the dictionaries we
currently send, while eliminating those that are ridiculously big.
   </p>
   <p>
    Our intention is
    <strong>
     not
    </strong>
    for experienced volunteers who
are shelving dictionaries to open every dictionary and examine the
number of pages. The page limit is intended more as a helpful guideline
to give to a donor who says "I have an excellent hardcover dictionary in
my office that I'd like to donate to you, but it's so big that I'm not
sure you could use it". Now, instead of a long discussion about what "so
big" actually means, we can simply respond with "If it contains fewer
than 2,000 pages and has a copyright date of 1980 or later, we'll take
it!"
