title: "Postage Rates, Effective 7/10/2022"
---
<p><em>[Last updated: July 12, 2022]</em></p>

<p>USPS increased its postage rates on July 10, 2022. Below is
information on the new rates. We have verified the cost to send Media
Mail packages of 1, 2, and 3 pounds by sending test packages. The other
information is believed to be accurate, but due to previous instances of
USPS sources providing inaccurate information, we lack full confidence in
it. <strong>Please alert Maya and Jen if you discover any inaccuracies 
below.</strong>

<p>Note 1: The underlying rule behind the rates listed above is that
for packages weighing 1-7 pounds, the first pound costs $3.49 and each
additional pound costs 67 cents. <strong>Warning: After the first 7
pounds, the rule changes and each additional pound costs 70
cents.</strong></p>

<p>Note 2: In the table above, the third column shows suggested
stamp combinations for using up leftover stamps.com postage that
was printed at the August 2021 rates. The suggested combination for
3-pound packages uses postage stickers that used to be the 
correct postage for 2-pound packages. If you instead have 
$4.45 postage stickers that you want to get rid
of, you can add four 10-cent stamps to get the current $4.83 postage for
a 3-pound package (overpaying by 2 cents). 
</p>

<h2>First-Class Mail</h2>

<p>Letter-sized envelopes weighing up to one ounce now cost cost 60
cents to mail. Large envelopes (called "flats" by USPS) weighing up
to one ounce cost $1.20 (two forever stamps) to mail.
Additional ounces cost 24 cents regardless of the
size of the envelope.</p>

<p><strong>Note: Do not overstuff letter-sized envelopes.</strong>
Letter-sized envelopes should weigh less than 3.5 ounces and be
less than 1/4 inch thick. Exceeding these limits can cause an
envelope to be considered a "parcel" rather than a "letter",
resulting in drastic increases in cost.</p>

<p>The simplest way to pay for first-class mail is to apply the
appropriate stamp(s) for the first ounce (i.e. one forever stamp
for a letter-sized envelope or two forever stamps for a large
envelope) then apply as many "additional ounce" stamps as are
needed. However, for the benefit of anyone trying to use up other
types of stamps, below are the rates for large envelopes.</p>

<p>Note: This means that any large envelope weighing more than 10
ounces would be cheaper to send by Media Mail than by First-Class
Mail. (Unfortunately, many large envelopes are ineligible for being
mailed this way, but a few are eligible for being sent by either
method.)</p>

<p>Although BtP doesn't send postcards or international mail, we
sometimes use "postcard forever" and "international forever" stamps.
"Postcard forever" stamps are now worth 44 cents and 
"international forever" stamps are worth
$1.40.</p>
