title: "Postage Rates, Effective 7/10/2022"
---
<p><em>[Last updated: June 23, 2022]</em></p>

<p>USPS is expected to increase its postage rates on July 10, 2022. In
the past, we have frequently been given information on upcoming rate
increases that turned out to be incorrect. <strong>Because of this, we
will not have full confidence in the new rates until a volunteer mails
some test packages on July 11.</strong> However, the following reflects
the best information currently available to us.</p>

<h2>Media Mail</h2>

<p>Note 1: The underlying rule beneath the rates listed above is that
for packages weighing 1-7 pounds, the first pound costs $3.49 and each
additional pound costs 67 cents. <strong>Warning: After the first 7
pounds, the rule changes and each additional pound costs 70
cents.</strong></p>

<p>Note 2: In the table above, the third column shows suggested
stamp combinations for using up leftover stamps.com postage that
was printed at the August 2021 rates.
</p>

<h2>First-Class Mail</h2>

<p>Letter-sized envelopes weighing up to one ounce will cost 60
cents to mail. Large envelopes (called "flats" by USPS) weighing up
to one ounce will cost $1.20 (two forever stamps) to mail.
Additional ounces will cost 24 cents regardless of the
size of the envelope.</p>

<p><strong>Note: Do not overstuff letter-sized envelopes.</strong>
Letter-sized envelopes should weigh less than 3.5 ounces and be
less than 1/4 inch thick. Exceeding these limits can cause an
envelope to be considered a "parcel" rather than a "letter",
resulting in drastic increases in cost.</p>

<p>The simplest way to pay for first-class mail is to apply the
appropriate stamp(s) for the first ounce (i.e. one forever stamp
for a letter-sized envelope or two forever stamps for a large
envelope) then apply as many "additional ounce" stamps as are
needed. However, for the benefit of anyone trying to use up other
types of stamps, below are the rates for large envelopes.</p>

<p>Note: This means that any large envelope weighing more than 10
ounces would be cheaper to send by Media Mail than by First-Class
Mail. (Unfortunately, many large envelopes are ineligible for being
mailed this way, but a few are eligible for being sent by either
method.)</p>

<p>Although BtP doesn't send postcards or international mail, we
sometimes use "postcard forever" and "international forever" stamps.
After the rate change goes into effect, "Postcard forever" stamps will
be worth 44 cents and "international forever" stamps will be worth
$1.40.</p>
