is information on the new rates.

<h2>Media Mail</h2>

<p>The underlying rule behind the rates listed above is that
the first pound costs $4.63 and each
additional pound costs 75 cents.
</p>

<h2>First-Class Mail</h2>

<p>Letter-sized envelopes weighing up to one ounce cost 73
cents to mail. Additional ounces cost 28 cents.
</p>

<p>Large envelopes (called "flats" by USPS) weighing up to
one ounce cost $1.50 to mail. In a striking change to past
practice, additional ounces are now of variable cost,
according to page 6 of USPS's 67-page guide to the new
rates. The chart is reproduced below. (One volunteer has
speculated that USPS's chart contains typos and will be
corrected at some point. We shall see.)
</p>

<p><strong>Note: Do not overstuff envelopes.</strong>
Letter-sized envelopes should weigh less than 3.5 ounces and be
less than 1/4 inch thick. 
Flats should weigh
less than 13 ounces and be less than 3/4 inch thick.
Exceeding these limits can cause an
envelope to be considered a "parcel" rather than a "letter" or
"flat",
resulting in drastic increases in cost. 
</p>

<p>To pay for letter-sized envelopes, apply one forever stamp
and the appropriate number of extra-ounce stamps. To determine
the cost to mail a
large envelope ("flat"), refer to the chart below.

<p>Note: This means that any large envelope weighing more than 12
ounces would be cheaper to send by Media Mail than by First-Class
Mail. (Unfortunately, many large envelopes are ineligible for being
mailed this way, but a few are eligible for being sent by either
method.)</p>

<p>Although BtP doesn't send postcards or international mail, we
sometimes use "postcard forever" and "international forever" stamps.
"Postcard forever" stamps are worth 56 cents and 
"international forever" stamps are worth
$1.65.</p>

<p>We believe that all the information above is correct, but it is easy to
make mistakes when dealing with long price lists. 
If you discover                                       
any inaccuracies in the information above, please alert both Jen and
Maya immediately.
