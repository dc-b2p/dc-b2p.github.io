<h2>Media Mail</h2>

<p>The underlying rule behind the rates listed above is that
the first pound costs $3.92 and each
additional pound costs 75 cents.
</p>

<h2>First-Class Mail</h2>

<p>Letter-sized envelopes weighing up to one ounce cost 66
cents to mail. Large envelopes (called "flats" by USPS) weighing up
to one ounce cost $1.35 to mail. (Note: The new rate means that 
it is no longer possible to pay for a flat by using two forever
stamps, as was the case in the past.)
Additional ounces continue to cost 24 cents regardless of the
size of the envelope.</p>

<p><strong>Note: Do not overstuff letter-sized envelopes.</strong>
Letter-sized envelopes should weigh less than 3.5 ounces and be
less than 1/4 inch thick. Exceeding these limits can cause an
envelope to be considered a "parcel" rather than a "letter",
resulting in drastic increases in cost.</p>

<p>The simplest way to pay for first-class mail is to apply the
appropriate stamp(s) for the first ounce (i.e. one forever stamp
for a letter-sized envelope or two forever stamps plus a 3-cent
stamp for a large
envelope) then apply as many "additional ounce" stamps as are
needed. However, for the benefit of anyone trying to use up other
types of stamps, below are the rates for large envelopes.</p>

<p>Note: This means that any large envelope weighing more than 11
ounces would be cheaper to send by Media Mail than by First-Class
Mail. (Unfortunately, many large envelopes are ineligible for being
mailed this way, but a few are eligible for being sent by either
method.)</p>

<p>Although BtP doesn't send postcards or international mail, we
sometimes use "postcard forever" and "international forever" stamps.
"Postcard forever" stamps are worth 51 cents and 
"international forever" stamps are worth
$1.50.</p>

<p>We believe that all the information above is correct, but it is easy to
make mistakes when dealing with long price lists. 
If you discover                                       
any inaccuracies in the information above, please alert both Jen and
