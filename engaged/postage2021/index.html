<p>Note 1: The underlying rule beneath the rates listed above is
that the first pound costs $2.89 and each additional pound costs 56
cents.</p>

<p>Note 2: In the table above, the third column shows suggested
stamp combinations for using up leftover stamps.com postage that
was printed at the 2020 rates. These combinations involve
overpaying for 1-pound packages by 1 cent and overpaying for
4-pound packages by 2 cents.</p>

<h2>First-Class Mail</h2>

<p>Most rates remain the same. Letter-sized envelopes weighing up
to one ounce continue to cost 55 cents, and large envelopes (called
"flats" by USPS) weighing up to one ounce continue to cost $1.
However, "additional ounces" now cost 20 cents regardless of the
size of the envelope. (Previously, additional ounces cost 15 cents
if the envelope was letter-sized and 20 cents if the envelope was
large.)</p>

<p><strong>Note: Do not overstuff letter-sized envelopes.</strong>
Letter-sized envelopes should weigh less than 3.5 ounces and be
less than 1/4 inch thick. Exceeding these limits can cause an
envelope to be considered a "parcel" rather than a "letter",
resulting in drastic increases in cost.</p>

<p>The simplest way to pay for first-class mail is to apply the
appropriate stamp for the first ounce (i.e. a forever stamp for a
letter-sized envelope or a $1 stamp for a large envelope) then
apply as many "additional ounce" stamps as are needed. However, for
the benefit of anyone trying to use up other types of stamps, below
are the rates for large envelopes.</p>

<p>Note: This means that any large envelope weighing more than 10
ounces would be cheaper to send by Media Mail than by First-Class
Mail. (Unfortunately, many large envelopes are ineligible for being
mailed this way, but a few are eligible for being sent by either
method.)</p>
