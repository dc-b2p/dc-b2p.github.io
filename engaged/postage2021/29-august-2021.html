title: "Postage Rates, Effective 8/29/2021"

<p><em>[Last updated: July 20, 2021]</em></p>

<p>USPS is expected to increase its postage rates on August 29,
2021. <strong>There is some uncertainty as to the details, and we
will not be confident of the new rates until a volunteer mails some
test packages on August 30.</strong> However, the following
reflects the best information currently available to us.</p>

<h2>Media Mail</h2>

<p>Note 1: The underlying rule beneath the rates listed above is
that the first pound costs $3.19 and each additional pound costs 63
cents.</p>

<p>Note 2: In the table above, the third column shows suggested
stamp combinations for using up leftover stamps.com postage that
was printed at the January 2021 rates. These combinations involve
overpaying for 2-pound packages by 3 cents. HOWEVER, if we buy
40-cent stamps (which are technically "postcard forever" stamps)
before the rate increase, they will cost us only 36 cents each.</p>
<h2>First-Class Mail</h2>

<p>Letter-sized envelopes weighing up to one ounce will cost 58
cents to mail. Large envelopes (called "flats" by USPS) weighing up
to one ounce will cost $1.16 (two forever stamps) to mail.
Additional ounces will continue to cost 20 cents regardless of the
size of the envelope.</p>

<p><strong>Note: Do not overstuff letter-sized envelopes.</strong>
Letter-sized envelopes should weigh less than 3.5 ounces and be
less than 1/4 inch thick. Exceeding these limits can cause an
envelope to be considered a "parcel" rather than a "letter",
resulting in drastic increases in cost.</p>

<p>The simplest way to pay for first-class mail is to apply the
appropriate stamp(s) for the first ounce (i.e. one forever stamp
for a letter-sized envelope or two forever stamps for a large
envelope) then apply as many "additional ounce" stamps as are
needed. However, for the benefit of anyone trying to use up other
types of stamps, below are the rates for large envelopes.</p>

    <td>$1.36</td>

    <td>$1.56</td>

    <td>5</td>

<p>Note: This means that any large envelope weighing more than 11
ounces would be cheaper to send by Media Mail than by First-Class
Mail. (Unfortunately, many large envelopes are ineligible for being
mailed this way, but a few are eligible for being sent by either
method.)</p>

<h2>Priority Mail</h2>

<p>According to <a
href="https://blog.stamps.com/2021/06/04/usps-to-implement-second-postage-rate-increase-in-2021/">stamps.com's
blog</a>, USPS didn't ask the Postal Regulatory Commission for
permission to increase Priority Mail rates, but "This could change
as additional USPS announcements are expected".</p>
