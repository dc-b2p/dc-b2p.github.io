title: "Curator Responsibilities"
---
<p><strong><em>Last updated June 23, 2022</em></strong></p>

<p>Curators are responsible for maintaining their shelves,
including:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Weeding for condition</strong> (ridding of water stains
    and nudity, where appropriate; use of sand paper). This requires
    the curator to be intimately familiar with the condition
    requirements and regularly check for books that do not pass the
    conditions restrictions.</li>
<li><strong>Weeding for content</strong> (cutting down volume of
    books if they deem outdated or of no interest to our readers;
    placing overflow of books on the closet shelves or refilling
    shelves from overflow in the closet).</li>
<li>Keeping an eye out on the <strong>number of handout
    printouts</strong> available (if handouts are on their shelves)
    and letting Chris or Stephanie know when to make
    more.</li>
<li><strong>Helping shelvers</strong> 
    look through donations for books in their category. They
    may also give shelvers guidance on easily identifiable books they
    want or don't want.</li>
<li>Letting the book acquisition
    coordinator, Maya, Jen, Megan, and Kristen know if 
    they're <strong>in need of a specific
    book(s).</strong> The request can be posted <a
    href="http://dcbookstoprisoners.org/donate-books/">on our web
    site</a> (through Jen), on Facebook (through Megan or Kristen),
    on Twitter (through Jen) or added to our Amazon Wish list (through
    Maya).</li>
<li>Being willing to <strong>communicate with a donor</strong>
    and/or someone at BtP about storage requirements, if someone would
    like to make a large donation of books in their category.</li>
<li>Letting Maya know if a category or an author
    had become popular and the supply doesn't meet demand and needs
    a Red Label to denote as such.</li>
</ul>

<p>The responsibility for what stays on the shelf rests with the
curator. The only time someone other than the curator can weed a
shelf is to remove a book with stains or nudity. All other
decisions about what should be on the shelf belong to the
curator.</p>
