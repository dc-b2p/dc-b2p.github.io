    Curators are responsible for maintaining their shelves, including:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <strong>
      Weeding for condition
     </strong>
     (ridding of water stains
and nudity, where appropriate; use of sand paper). This requires
the curator to be intimately familiar with the condition requirements
and regularly check for books that do not pass the conditions
restrictions.
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong>
      Weeding for content
     </strong>
     (cutting down volume of books
if they deem outdated or of no interest to our readers; placing overflow
of books on the closet shelves or refilling shelves from overflow in the
closet).
    </li>
    <li>
     Keeping an eye out on the
     <strong>
      number of handout
printouts
     </strong>
     available (if handouts are on their shelves) and letting
Chris, Susan, Daria or Stephanie know when to make more.
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong>
      Helping shelvers
     </strong>
     (Ian, Daria, Chris and others) look
through donations for books in their category. They may also
give shelvers guidance on easily identifiable books they want or don't
want.
    </li>
    <li>
     Letting Susan, Daria, Ian, Jen, Chris and the book acquisition
coordinator know if they're
     <strong>
      in need of a specific
book(s).
     </strong>
     The request can be posted
     <a href="http://dcbookstoprisoners.org/donate-books/">
      on our web site
     </a>
     (through Jen), on Facebook (through Megan or Kristen), on Twitter
(through Jen) or added to our Amazon Wish list (through Susan).
    </li>
    <li>
     Being willing to
     <strong>
      communicate with a donor
     </strong>
     and/or
someone at BtP about storage requirements, if someone would like to make
a large donation of books in their category.
    </li>
    <li>
     Letting Susan, Daria or Maya know if a category or an author had
become popular and the supply doesn't meet demand and needs a Red Label
to denote as such.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    The responsibility for what stays on the shelf rests with
the curator. The only time someone other than the curator can weed a
shelf is to remove a book with stains or nudity. All other decisions
about what should be on the shelf belong to the curator.
