    <strong>February 2022: Update on volunteering</strong>
    <br />
    We currently allow a maximum of five volunteers in
              our workspace at one time. Volunteers must be
              vaccinated and
    <strong>must sign up in advance for the
              hour(s) during which they will volunteer</strong>.
              We regret that at this time we are unable to accept
              first-time volunteers. If you volunteered with us
              prior to the pandemic and would like to resume
              volunteering, please visit our
    <strong><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/volunteer/covid.html">Volunteering
              During the Pandemic</a></strong>

    <strong>September 2021: Accepting book donations at Foundry again</strong>
    <br />
    We are pleased to announce that we can once again accept book
               donations in our room in the basement of Foundry United Methodist
               Church. Books will be accepted Wednesday evenings 6-8pm. In
               compliance with Foundry's mask policy and DC law, people dropping
               off books must wear masks that cover both their mouths
    <strong>and noses</strong>. More details on dropping off books
               are available on our

    <strong>Summer 2021: New newsletter released</strong>
    <br />
    Our
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/newsletters/202106.html">summer newsletter</a>
    features letters from 12 incarcerated readers. Read about Taylor's
               wish to learn how to manage a diner and Jonathan's desire for
               books to help him "become a better person".

    <strong>July 1, 2021: Incorporated as a 501(c)(3) non-profit</strong>
    <br />
    We are proud to announce that after 22 years as a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_sponsorship">
     sponsored
               program</a>
    of other non-profit
               groups, most recently
    <a href="https://www.empowermentworks.org">
     Empowerment
               WORKS</a>, we have become an incorporated 501(c)(3)
               non-profit. With the change, we have our own non-profit status
               and all donations flow directly to us.

    includes a letter from Christopher in Arkansas and a stunning
               card from Angel in Texas.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>Tuesday, December 22, 2020: Discussion on the Kojo Nnamdi Show</strong>
    <br />
    One of our volunteers participated in a discussion on the
    <a href="https://thekojonnamdishow.org/shows/2020-12-22/an-inside-scoop-reading-writing-and-journalism-for-people-in-the-d-c-jail">
     Kojo
               Nnamdi Show</a>
    on WAMU 88.5. Among the topics discussed were the stringent
               rules we
               have to follow when mailing books to prisoners.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>Summer 2020: New newsletter released</strong>
    <br />
    Our
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/newsletter202006/">summer newsletter</a>
    describes our ongoing service to prisoners despite our city
               being shut down.

    <strong>Winter 2019-2020: New newsletter released</strong>
    <br />
    Our
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/newsletter202001/">winter newsletter</a>
    contains articles about our recent 20th anniversary celebration,
               the upcoming change in our fiscal sponsor (which will affect
               how we receive monetary donations), and the ways that targeted book
               donations transform prison life. Best of all, it contains
               excerpts of two letters from incarcerated readers, Robert in
               Texas and Brandi in Oklahoma.

    <strong>Nut-free policy</strong>
    <br />
    To ensure the safety of a person with a severe allergy to nuts,
               the building we operate out of has gone nut-free.
               Please do not bring any foods containing nuts into the building.

    <strong>November 3, 2019: New newsletter released</strong>
    <br />
    What do these things have in common: PEN America, the Seattle Review
               of Books, the GED test, and eating donuts hanging from strings?
    <br />
    Answer: All of them are mentioned in our
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/newsletter201911">November 2019 newsletter</a>.
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>September 28, 2019: Letter published in The Washington Post</strong>
    <br />
    One of our volunteers, Ian, had a letter published in The Washington Post.
               To read it,

   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>August 21, 2019: New Location</strong>
    <br />
    On Wednesday, August 21, 2019, we moved to a new room.
               We're in the same building as before, and are even on the same floor,
               but we're now in room B1. Please come and see us in our new location!

    <strong>May 31, 2019: Tabling at Politics and Prose Bookstore</strong>
    <br />
    Thank you to everyone who visited us at
    <a href="https://www.politics-prose.com/">
     Politics and
               Prose</a>'s
    Connecticut Avenue store on Friday, May 31, 2019! We enjoyed
               meeting many friends of our program, and are grateful to everyone who purchased
               books for us or mentioned us at the
               cash register (which resulted in us receiving 20% of the sale).
               Our thanks to Politics and Prose for
               this opportunity to raise funds, obtain books, and meet DC's book lovers!
   </p>

    <strong>Two Successful Fundraisers, Both Involving Cupcakes</strong>
    <br />
    We were the April 2019 Charity of the Month at
    <a href="http://www.stickyfingersbakery.com">
     Sticky Fingers
              Sweets &amp; Eats</a>
    in Columbia Heights, receiving money for each
              Charity-of-the-Month cupcake sold that month.
              Then, in May, volunteers baked a wide variety of baked goods,
              selling them at a bake sale at Foundry United Methodist Church on May 19.
              We are grateful to everyone who participated in these fundraisers.
              Every $4 raised will result in another prisoner receiving books!
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>Victory in Maryland!</strong>
    <br />
    In April 2018, we abruptly lost the ability to send books to prisoners
              in Maryland state prisons when the state implemented a new policy allowing
              only two vendors to send books to prisoners. Not even Amazon was allowed to
              send books to prisoners. On June 11, 2018, after weeks of protest by Maryland
              residents, the ACLU, and other groups (including DC Books to Prisons),
              the new policy was rescinded!
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/maryland-book-ban">Read more about the rescinded policy.</a>
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>{{ "Snow Policy" | downcase }}</strong>
    <br />
    The building we operate out of follows the federal government
              in deciding when to declare a snow day. If OPM reports that
              the federal government is closed due to snow, it means that we,
              too, are closed.
