<p>Founded in 1999, DC Books to Prisons provides free books to                
individual prisoners. We also develop and support prison libraries.           
Our work is done solely by concerned volunteers using donated time            
and resources. DC Books to Prisons is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit                   
organization located in Washington DC.</p>                                                             
                                                                              
<p>Each year, we send more than 7,000 book packages to prisoners in           
over 600 prisons in the United States. We serve state and federal             
prisoners in 34 states, and federal prisoners in Arizona. With the            
exception of DC residents in federal prisons, we do not serve                 
inmates in CT, FL, IL, MA, ME, MI, NH, NJ, NY, OR, PA, RI, VT, WA,            
or WI.</p>                                                                    
                                                                              
<p>The U.S. has less than five percent of the world's population,             
yet more than 25 percent of the world's prisoners. Nearly one                 
percent of American adults are incarcerated; the highest rate in              
the world. However, many prisoners have little access to books or             
educational material. Usually, prisoners are not allowed to receive           
books from friends or family. While some prisons have libraries,              
many do not. Of prisons that do, access and selection can be                  
extremely limited. Programs like ours are one of the few options              
available to prisoners seeking books.</p>                                     
                                                                              
<p>There are a number of similar projects throughout the country,             
so if you are looking to get involved but are not in the 
Washington DC area,
