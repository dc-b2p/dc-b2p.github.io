<p>I am 43 years old, from Winston-Salem NC, and I am&hellip;discovering
that positive, constructive reading can transform the mis-formed
negative mentality into an open, objective-minded, reality-based
personality.

<p>I greatly appreciate your help and assistance on my journey. May
peace rest in your heart and soul&hellip;Knowledge gained, knowledge not
shared, is knowledge abused!

<p>The books you have sent to so many prisoners have changed
countless lives and helped them to escape the world of prison.
Additionally, many books have become educational and I have
personally seen may prisoners become interested in what they have
read and often ask questions concerning the topic. In a way, this
restores my faith in humanity, forgiveness and compassion.

<p>I would like to thank you and your coworkers for all that you do
to help incarcerated people. You all are a blessing to all of us,
and I appreciate all that you do.
