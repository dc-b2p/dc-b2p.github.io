<p><i>"Books are how we teach ourselves to be better people. Books help us get 
into the minds and hearts and experiences of other people. Books foster 
empathy and they help us aspire to being a little better tomorrow than 
we are today."</i> --Paul Constant, 
<a href="https://seattlereviewofbooks.com/notes/2019/04/03/how-you-can-help-fight-for-the-right-to-read-in-washington-state-prisons/">The 
Seattle Review of Books</a>
</p>


<h2>Incarcerated Student Obtains GED</h2>

<p>We were delighted to receive this letter in the mail from Logan, who is
incarcerated in Kenedy, Texas:
</p>

<p><i>"Thanks to your [program], I was able to get my GED. I want to give 
all your staff a big shoutout and thank you! Because of y'all sending me 
a couple study guides and GED testing books, I now have completed the 
GED test and got my diploma. Thanks for everything. God bless."</i>
</p>

<p>The GED preparation book we had sent to Logan had been donated by 
someone who knew of the need for it as a result of browsing our <a 
href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1NBVRRZGMJX3Q?">Amazon Wish 
List</a>. We are immensely grateful to the donor, and know that Logan 
is too!
</p>

<h2>Creative Fundraisers Allow Books to Travel the Country</h2>

<p>Donated books wouldn't do prisoners any good if they sat in our room in 
Washington, DC. In order to mail over 6,000 packages of books to 
prisoners each year, we need money to pay USPS for shipping.
Fortunately, we are blessed to have many supporters who donate
postage funds. Some donate directly, while others hold creative
fundraisers. In this newsletter, we are highlighting some of the
fundraisers that have enabled us to mail thousands of book packages.
</p>

<h3>Fall Fest at Oliver Fire Protection &amp; Security</h3>

<p>Every year, <a href="https://oliverfps.com/">Oliver Fire Protection &amp; Security</a>, 
a company based in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, holds a month of fundraising activities 
and donates the proceeds to charity. We were honored to be chosen as the beneficiary for 
2018. Employees paid to participate in a variety of activities, and at the end of the 
month attended a fun-filled Fall Fest. The light-hearted competitions at the Fall Fest 
included one in which participants had to eat donuts hanging from strings (see photo below).
</p>

<p><img src="fallfest.jpg" align="right" 
alt="[Photo of three people attempting to eat donuts that are hanging on strings. 
The people all have their hands behind their backs.]">
</p>

<p>Oliver Fire Protection &amp; Security also held a book drive for us, resulting in seven
boxes of carefully-chosen books. Especially appreciated were some role-playing game (RPG) books,
which are in very high demand in prisons. (Participating in RPGs provides prisoners with social
interaction, and has been noted to be one of the few activities in men's prisons that is
often racially integrated.)
</p>

<p>We are very grateful to Oliver Fire Protection &amp; Security for its generosity to us and
the prisoners we serve!
</p>

<h3>Cupcakes</h3>

<p>Another fun fundraiser was the one held for us by 
<a href="http://www.stickyfingersbakery.com">Sticky Fingers
Sweets &amp; Eats</a>, a bakery and cafe in the Columbia Heights neighborhood
of Washington, DC. As Sticky Fingers' Charity of the Month for April 2019,
we received $1 for each almond creme cupcake sold that month.
</p>

<p>Cupcakes and other baked goods were also sold in an unrelated bake sale
held at <a href="http://foundryumc.org/">Foundry United Methodist Church</a> in May.
Our volunteers did the baking for this annual event, and church members flocked to
purchase delicious treats.
</p>

<h3>Tabling at Politics and Prose Bookstore</h3>

<p>One day each year, the Connecticut Avenue location of
<a href="https://www.politics-prose.com/">Politics and Prose</a> allows us to table in
their store, allowing us to meet lots of book lovers and talk to them about the books
we need (many of which are sold at the store). Additionally, if customers mention us at
the cash register on that day, we receive 20% of the sale!
</p>

<h3>Readathons</h3>

<p>In April, our volunteer Amanda shared with us the wonderful news that she had held a 
readathon, soliciting donations from her Facebook followers for each page read. Showing 
amazing dedication to BtP, she read for 24 hours, and kept her followers informed 
of her progress with frequent updates.
</p>

<p>In September, a local alternative religious group also held a readathon. Dubbed 
"Lucre for Literacy", it attracted participants from as far away as Philadelphia. 
A whopping 1,036 pages were read, and a check was sent to us along with a beautiful card 
affirming the value of books.
</p>

<h2>We've Moved!</h2>

<p>Our program could not operate without space generously provided to
us by <a href="http://foundryumc.org/">Foundry United Methodist Church</a>.
Foundry recently moved us from the room we had been operating in for many
years to another room on the same floor. Supporters who wish to stop by
with book donations can now find us in room B1. We are immensely grateful
to Foundry for continuing to host our volunteers and books!
</p>

<h2>Updates</h2>

<h3>Book Restrictions</h3>

<p>In a previous newsletter, we described severe restrictions on books for
prisoners in several states. 
<a href="https://www.inquirer.com/philly/news/pennsylvania-book-ban-doc-books-through-bars-wetzel-20181102.html">For 
prisoners in Pennsylvania, 
there is partial good news.</a> Prison book programs can now send books to
a central facility, and in theory all books are then sent on to their intended
recipients. However, there are reports of some book packages being rejected.
</p>

<p>Numerous organizations are now taking an interest in prison book restrictions. One of 
the most prominent is PEN America, which recently launched a campaign called 
<a href="https://www.pen.org/banned-books-2019">Literature Locked 
Up</a> that seeks to end book bans in prisons. As part of the campaign, PEN publicized 
<a href="https://www.pen.org/literature-locked-up-banned-books-2019">a few examples of books 
banned in prisons</a>.
</p>

<p>News outlets are also talking about prison book restrictions. One of our volunteers, 
Jackie, was recently quoted in 
<a href="https://bookriot.com/2019/10/21/censorship-in-american-prisons/">a Book Riot 
article about censorship in prisons</a>.
</p>


<h3>2,000 Libros</h3>

<p>When we first wrote about 2,000 Libros, the project had just begun, 
with a goal of sending 2,000 books ("libros" in Spanish) to children in 
immigration detention facilities. At the time, around 2,000 children had 
recently been torn from their families and placed in detention, and the 
goal was to send one book per child.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce that the project succeeded in acquiring 
and shipping 2,000 books! These books provided comfort to children at a 
time when they most needed it, and also helped with improving literacy 
and fostering a love of reading.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, in the time it took to send 2,000 books, more children 
were detained and became in need of books. The project continues to 
collect books to send to children in detention, primarily Spanish and 
bilingual books.</p>

<p>Recent donors have included:
<ul>
<li> Chronicle Books (105 books)</li>
<li> Mara Wilson (75 copies of Mathilda)</li>
<li> Shout Mouse Press (237 copies of Voces Sin Fronteras)</li>
<li> Lufi and Friends (10 song books)</li>
<li> Kendra Hyett (109 books, including Harry Potter books in Spanish)</li>
<li> The American Psychological Association and Magination Press (400 Spanish-language
workbooks geared toward helping kids work through issues with anxiety and worry)</li>
</ul>

<p>Many other people have donated smaller quantities of books, most of 
them through wish lists at 
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/registry/wishlist/YE7CDP3XCWFX">Amazon</a> 
or local bookstore <a href="http://www.politics-prose.com/wishlist/984">Politics and Prose</a>. 
We are grateful to all donors, past and future, for their support of 
this initiative to support detained children.</p>

<h2>Letter from an Incarcerated Reader</h2>

<p>We end this newsletter as we began it, with a letter from an incarcerated reader. This 
letter came from Marc, who requested manga, RPG books, and sci-fi and fantasy novels: </p>

<p><i>"Thank you guys for helping us out, and
taking time out of your lives to help keep us going. Your services are
appreciated infinity times over. There are a lot of people nowadays
that the only stuff they can get in is from donations and the
hard-working people behind the donations. :-) Thank you again from me
and many others."</i>
