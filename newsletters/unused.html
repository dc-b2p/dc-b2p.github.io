<h2>Keeping Our Volunteers Safe</h2>

<p>During the early months of the pandemic, when the church that hosts us 
was closed, a core group of volunteers prepared book packages in their 
homes. Thankfully, those days are behind us, and we are once again 
working in the basement of Foundry United Methodist Church.</p>

<p>Because the pandemic is ongoing and we need to protect the health of our 
volunteers, especially those who are medically vulnerable, we have made 
several changes to our pre-pandemic procedures:</p>

<ul>

<li>We limit how many volunteers can be in the room at one time, and
require volunteers to sign up for their hours in advance. (If you
volunteered with us before the pandemic, contact btopdc@gmail.com to
request access to the calendar used for this purpose.)</li>

<li>We require all people working in the room to wear masks.</li>

<li>We run a HEPA air purifier.</li>
</ul>

<p>These procedures have enabled many of our pre-pandemic volunteers to
return, and we have also been able to welcome some wonderful new volunteers.
If you have not previously volunteered with us and would like to start, 
contact btopdc@gmail.com and ask to be added to our orientation wait 
list.

<h2>Forgotten Treasures</h2>

<p><em>"I want you to keep this letter and read it in times of 
difficulty."</em> This sentence appears near the end of a deeply moving 
letter of love and support. Was it a letter from a volunteer to a 
prisoner? No. Was it a letter from a prisoner to a volunteer? Also no.</p>

<p>The letter was sent to a person who did not, as far as we know, have any 
connection to anyone in prison. The person apparently treasured the 
letter, keeping it flat within the pages of a book. Unfortunately, the 
letter was forgotten when the book was later given away.</p>

<p>We find similar items almost every week. Some appear to have been placed 
in books for safekeeping, while others were clearly being used as 
bookmarks. Items have included a child's artwork, family photos, two 
prescriptions from an otorhinolaryngologist for controlled substances, 
pressed flowers, a tax form (complete with enough information to steal 
the recipient's identity), a lottery ticket, dollar bills, business 
cards, a membership card for a golf club, and airplane boarding passes. 
Recently, a volunteer learned about purchases her spouse had made when 
she discovered three of his credit card receipts in a book!</p>

<p>We check books carefully before sending them, both to protect the 
privacy of book donors and to prevent the incarcerated recipients of 
books from getting in trouble for possessing "contraband". However, we 
are seldom able to reunite the misplaced treasures found within books 
with their rightful owners.</p>

<p>So, if you plan to donate books to us, please flip through them first 
and remove any items you find.</p>


<h2>Letters from Incarcerated Readers</h2>

<p>"I'd like to thank you for what you do for us unfortunate[s]. I am 
currently in super max (AKA the hole) and reading material/education is 
sparse. So having your organization to make my circumstance more 
bearable is a real blessing. Thank you and God bless." 
<span class="signature">&mdash;Bobby,</span> Utah</p>

<p>"I like to read books and itâ€™s how I do my time. I have no help from 
family, relatives or friends. I am having a hard time doing time. I am 
thankful for places like DC [Books to Prisons] who help people like me 
get some books so thank you all." 
<span class="signature">&mdash;Hector,</span> California</p>

<p>"Another inmate at my facility recently got a shipment from your 
organization, and he was not only grateful for such an amazing service, 
but thrilled with the selections you sent! I in turn asked him for your 
information, so I can make a request as well." 
<span class="signature">&mdash;Richaud,</span> North 
Carolina</p>

<p>"I'm writing to give you thanks for the little books you sent me; they 
are very useful for me and serve as a tool for drawing, which is 
basically what I do here to survive. Thank you!" 
<span class="signature">&mdash;J.,</span> South Carolina</p>


<p>"Thank you so much for caring enough to help me with books. I hope your 
good deed comes back to you 10 fold."
<span class="signature">&mdash;Larry,</span> North Carolina
</p>

<p>"Thank you for all you do for us. Know that your efforts are making a 
difference in us. Knowledge is the key."
<span class="signature">&mdash;Tommy,</span> Texas</p>

<p>"I want to start out by thanking you for all that you have done in 
helping us prisoners keep our sanity. You and other book places keep us 
mentally stable in a place that is meant to break us. Thank you so 
much." <span class="signature">&mdash;Robert,</span> Mississippi</p>
