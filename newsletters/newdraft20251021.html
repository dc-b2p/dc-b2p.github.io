<h2>Forgotten Treasures</h2>

<p><em>"I want you to keep this letter and read it in times of 
difficulty."</em> This sentence appears near the end of a deeply moving 
letter of love and support. Was it a letter from a volunteer to a 
prisoner? No. Was it a letter from a prisoner to a volunteer? Also no.</p>

<p>The letter was sent to a person who did not, as far as we know, have any 
connection to anyone in prison. The person apparently treasured the 
letter, keeping it flat within the pages of a book. Unfortunately, the 
letter was forgotten when the book was later given away.</p>

<p>We find similar items in used books almost every week. Some appear to
have been placed in books for safekeeping, while others were clearly
being used as bookmarks. Items have included a child's artwork, family
photos, two prescriptions from an otorhinolaryngologist for controlled
substances, pressed flowers, a tax form (complete with enough
information to steal the recipient's identity), a lottery ticket, dollar
bills, business cards, a membership card for a golf club, and airplane
boarding passes. Recently, a volunteer learned about purchases her
spouse had made when she discovered three of his credit card receipts in
a book!</p>

<p>We check books carefully before sending them, both to protect the 
privacy of book donors and to prevent the incarcerated recipients of 
books from getting in trouble for possessing "contraband". However, we 
are seldom able to reunite the misplaced treasures found within books 
with their rightful owners.</p>

<p>So, if you plan to donate books to us, please flip through them first 
and remove any items you find.</p>

<h2>Letters from Incarcerated Readers</h2>

<p>"I'd like to thank you for what you do for us unfortunate[s]. I am 
currently in super max (AKA the hole) and reading material/education is 
sparse. So having your organization to make my circumstance more 
bearable is a real blessing. Thank you and God bless." 
<span class="signature">&mdash;Bobby,</span> Utah</p>

<p>"I like to read books and it’s how I do my time. I have no help from 
family, relatives or friends. I am having a hard time doing time. I am 
thankful for places like DC [Books to Prisons] who help people like me 
get some books so thank you all." 
<span class="signature">&mdash;Hector,</span> California</p>

<p>"Thank you so much for caring enough to help me with books. I hope your 
good deed comes back to you 10 fold."
<span class="signature">&mdash;Larry,</span> North Carolina
</p>

<p>"I want to start out by thanking you for all that you have done in 
helping us prisoners keep our sanity. You and other book places keep us 
mentally stable in a place that is meant to break us. Thank you so 
much." <span class="signature">&mdash;Robert,</span> Mississippi</p>

<p>Some incarcerated people express themselves through art instead 
of words. Camilo in Texas thanked us for sending him adult coloring 
books by sending us many pages of drawings he had colored, including
these:</p>

<p align=center><img src="dog-squirrel.jpg" style="width:100%;" alt="Two pages removed from an adult coloring book. The one on the left shows a puppy with colorful flowers both around it and on it. The one on the right shows a squirrel surrounded by butterflies and flowers. The pictures look like they took hours to color.">

<h2>Books-in-Prisons News</h2>

<p>Many recent news articles have addressed various aspects of books
in prisons. Our favorite is the one written by journalist
Jackie Snow. If you missed it when it first came out, 
it isn't too late to read Ms. Snow's article,
<a href="https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/reading-behind-bars-and-beyond-barriers/"><strong>"Reading
Behind Bars, and Beyond Barriers"</strong></a>.</p> 

<p>We serve only people who are incarcerated in the United 
States, but two books-in-prisons news stories from 
the other side of the Atlantic Ocean caught our eye.
One was an article in Inside Time about a
<a href="https://insidetime.org/newsround/we-read-a-million-pages/"><strong>"Who 
wants to be a reading millionaire?"</strong></a> competition 
that brought together
both incarcerated people and prison staff to collectively read
one million pages. One participant said, "I have never read a 
book before, and this has made me read!" 
</p>

<p>Another Inside Time article celebrated the dropping of 
<a href="https://insidetime.org/mailbag/another-prison-drops-book-ban/"><strong>a 
book ban at a prison in England</strong></a>. The article noted that 
"The HMPPS Incentives Policy Framework, introduced in 2014, 
states that prisoners are entitled to receive books directly from 
their families and friends..." (Sadly, that isn't the policy here 
in the United States. If it were, we wouldn't be drowning in 
pleas for books!)
</p>

<p>Meanwhile, some good news in the United States is that 
Penguin Press and Penguin Random House Social Impact Team
partnered to 
<a href="https://global.penguinrandomhouse.com/announcements/penguin-press-and-penguin-random-house-social-impact-team-partner-to-donate-the-jailhouse-lawyer-to-incarcerated-individuals/"><strong>donate 
a special softcover edition of a book</strong></a> to
incarcerated individuals. The book, <i>The Jailhouse
Lawyer</i> by Calvin Duncan and Sophie Cull, was 
released in hardcover for a general audience, but
hardcover books are prohibited in many prisons.
The special softcover edition was produced so that
incarcerated readers would be able to read the book
at the same time it was released in hardcover to 
people who aren't incarcerated.
</p>

<p>In other positive news, a jail in Pennsylvania has 
installed a special 
<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/book-vending-machine-allegheny-county-jail/"><strong>vending 
machine</strong></a> that provides books to 
children who are visiting incarcerated
relatives.
</p>

<p>Sadly, not all news stories are as positive. Numerous articles are
about the problem of prisons censoring books and other publications. One
recent article described a lawsuit by a publisher that has had its
publications
<a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2025/07/lawsuit-censoring-inmates-reading-material-violates-publishers-rights/"><strong>rejected
by prison authorities in Hawai'i</strong></a> "56 times since the spring
of 2024". Another article described a detention facility that has 
<a href="https://nysfocus.com/2025/10/08/batavia-buffalo-detention-center-ice-book-ban"><strong>banned 
all book deliveries</strong></a>. Rejected books have included the self-help
title "The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work" and an illustrated
Spanish-English dictionary.
</p>

<h2>Two Special Weeks in October</h2>

<p>Many thanks to all the generous people who observed
<a href="https://bannedbooksweek.org/"><strong>Banned 
Books Week</strong></a> October 5-11, 2025, by participating
in our matching-grant book drive. We are thrilled to have 
received many highly-requested books, many of which are 
already on their way to incarcerated readers.
</p>

<p>Another special week in October was 
<a href="https://prisonbannedbooksweek.org/"><strong>Prison 
Banned Books Week</strong></a>, October 19-25, 2025.
Unlike the main Banned Books Week, this special week focused
exclusively on
the growing problem of prisons banning 
books.
</p>

<h2>Our Supporters are the Best!</h2>

<p>Every Wednesday, people find their way to our room 
carrying used books to donate to us. Some arrive wearing bicycle helmets, 
carrying only as many books as they can fit in their backpacks. Others 
come by car, bringing two boxes filled with books.</p>

<p>There are other people who live too far from Washington DC to bring us
books in person. Those people purchase new books from our 
<a href="https://politics-prose.com/wishlist/rocliswawresp"><strong>Politics and
Prose wish list</strong></a>,                                                 
<a href="https://bookshop.org/wishlists/a641ac4a61f8bc1f8a0da919f50c47ed25c4abfa"><strong>Bookshop.org
wish list</strong></a>,                                                       
or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2WMIIBWISY0RD"><strong>Amazon
wish list</strong></a>.
</p>

<p>Of course, the books wouldn't do any good sitting in our room, so we
have to mail them to the incarcerated readers who wish to receive them.
Mailing a typical book package costs almost $6. That money comes from
other supporters.</p>

<p>If you would like to join those supporters in contributing 
financially to our work, there are
two options for online giving. Our 
<strong><a href="https://www.paypal.com/fundraiser/charity/4021008">PayPal 
Giving
Fund page</a></strong> allows people with PayPal accounts to donate
to us without PayPal charging any fees. If you prefer to make a
recurring, monthly donation or do not have a PayPal account, please
visit our 
<strong><a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=PSH9GFLFNT7UC">regular
PayPal page</a></strong> (which allows donations using debit or
credit cards).</p>

<p>We also welcome checks, which should be made payable 
to "DC Books to Prisons" and sent to us at:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>DC Books to Prisons - Donations<br />
PO Box 34190<br />
Washington, DC 20043</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We give our heartfelt thanks to each and every one of our supporters,
without whom our work would not be possible. A special shout-out goes to 
<a href="https://foundryumc.org/"><strong>Foundry United Methodist
Church</strong></a> for continuing to host us and support our work.
