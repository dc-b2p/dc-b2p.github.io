<h2>August 5 Fundraiser: Punk Rock Karaoke</h2>

<p>Mailing books to prisoners like M. costs us around $6 per package, so 
we're grateful to local music venue The Black Cat for hosting a 
fundraiser for us! The fundraiser will be a punk rock karaoke night, and 
it will take place at 8pm on Saturday, August 5, 2023. Tickets will cost 
<a href="https://www.blackcatdc.com/shows/punk-rock-karaoke.html"><strong>$10 
in advance</strong></a> or $15 at the door. The Black Cat is located 
at 1811 14th Street NW in Washington DC. If you enjoy punk rock 
karaoke, please join us! (If you aren't into punk rock karaoke but have
friends who are, you can share 
<a href="black-cat-flyer.jpg"><strong>the flyer for 
the event</strong></a> with your friends.)

<h2>Our Recent Activities</h2>

<p>Our volunteers have been working hard to keep up with the demand for book 
packages. Most weeks this year, volunteers have been in our workspace four 
days a week, diligently answering requests for everything from comic books 
to dictionaries. If work continues at the same pace, we'll finish the year 
having sent approximately 8,000 packages.</p>

<p>Our wonderful supporters, including many of you receiving this
newsletter, have played an indispensable role by donating both books and
money. In April, many of you responded to the call to celebrate <a
href="https://bookweb.org/independent-bookstore-day"><strong>Independent
Bookstore Day</strong></a> by donating books through our <a
href="https://www.politics-prose.com/wishlist/960"><strong>Politics and
Prose wish list</strong></a>. Donations were matched by a foundation,
doubling the impact of each donation. Then, in July, generous donors
paid to offset the postage rate increase that went into effect on July
9. We thank you for your support! </p>

<p>We have resumed holding regular training sessions for new volunteers,
and some of the new volunteers have already achieved great things for
us. For example, one of them contacted local comic book stores
asking them to donate their 
<a href="https://www.freecomicbookday.com/"><strong>Free Comic Book
Day</strong></a> leftovers, resulting in a large donation. </p>

<p>Although we focus on serving individual prisoners, we continue to
maintain a list of prison libraries and educational programs that seek
book donations, and have made three additions to the list this year. If
you wish to support any of the programs on the list, contact
btopdc@gmail.com and we will send the list your way. </p>


<h2>Avoiding Waste, and Spreading the Joy of Books</h2>

<p>We welcome book donations, and send as many donated books as we can to 
prisoners. However, some donated books cannot be sent to prisoners, for 
a variety of reasons. As an example, some art books and even 
dictionaries are banned in prisons because they contain illustrations of 
the naked human form. Other books would be rejected by prisons because 
of tiny stains or spots of water damage. As much as possible, we avoid 
wasting these books.</p>

<p>Books that are in sellable condition are often sent to 
<a href="https://www.betterworldbooks.com/"><strong>Better 
World Books</strong></a>, which 
gives us credit that we can use to obtain books we need. Others are 
donated to 
<a href="https://turningthepage.org/get-involved/donate/"><strong>Turning 
the Page</strong></a>. Many are placed in Little Free Libraries 
around the city.</p>

<p>Occasionally, we are able to donate books directly to readers in need. 
One night, a volunteer leaving our workspace with a box of books for 
Little Free Libraries encountered an unhoused person who asked whether 
she could have some of the books to read. Naturally, our volunteer 
allowed her to take what she wanted. Another time, two boxes of books 
that couldn't be sent to prisoners were donated to a respite center for 
people who had fled their homes.</p>

<p>Although we are happy to share books with other organizations and 
individuals that can use them, a lot of labor goes into sorting, 
packing, and transporting these books, and this takes us from our 
primary purpose of sending books to prisoners. We therefore request that 
book donors read our 
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/donate-books/"><strong>guidance on book 
donations</strong></a> and donate only books that we will be able to send to 
prisoners. We accept book donations on Wednesdays 6-8pm in our room in 
the basement of Foundry United Methodist Church. (Please bring only two 
bags or boxes at a time. For larger donations, contact 
btopdc@gmail.com.)</p>

<h2>Letters from Incarcerated Readers</h2>

<p>"I give you thanks for the good labor you're doing sending books to we 
who are prisoners... I received what you sent me which I liked. I spent 
time reading instead of having bad thoughts." 
<span class="signature">&mdash;S.,</span> Texas</p>

<p>"I appreciate all your hard work to promote literacy and the love of 
reading. Reading is at times the only bright spots in my day. I've been 
especially glad to read more black/brown and woman authors recently, as 
well as foreign authors." 
<span class="signature">&mdash;Jason,</span> Kentucky</p>

<p>"Dear Friends, Thank you so dearly for the kindness & caring which 
honestly is such a blessing, by providing literature for me (and others) 
has granted me the possibility of being much more educated, a feat I 
heretofore thought to remain a vain undertaking. I've come a long way, 
thanks to you!" 
<span class="signature">&mdash;Cory,</span> North Carolina</p>

<p>"Thank you guys for everything you do. The sheer joy of receiving a 
package from you guys is the closest thing we get to unwrapping a 
present behind bars. These books do not come here to just die. They are 
passed around and enjoyed by so many others before they are eventually 
donated to the unit library. Thank you so much for giving a damn about 
our sanity. I can't tell you how much it is appreciated."
<span class="signature">&mdash;Ronald,</span> 
Texas</p>

<p>"It is a blessing to me that goes beyond words! What you are doing for 
those of us who are incarcerated means so much. It is easy to feel 
forgotten when behind these walls... To have such kindness shown from a 
stranger shows how bright each of you... shines." 
<span class="signature">&mdash;Lindsey,</span> Alabama</p>

<h2>Thank You</h2>

<p>We would like to thank everyone who supports our work. A hazard in 
having a thank-you section in a newsletter is that it will, 
inevitably, omit countless names that should be included. So, instead of
even attempting to list everyone we are thankful to, we are going 
to highlight just a handful of donors who are representative of our many 
supporters.</p>

<p>We thank the 
<a href="https://www.dclibraryfriends.org/Join"><strong>Friends 
of the Library groups</strong></a> that donate books to us,
including the Friends groups in Cleveland Park, Mount Pleasant, Georgetown,
Arlington, Centreville, and Great Falls.</p>

<p>We thank the publishers and others who have given us large quantities of 
publications, including 
<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/"><strong>ScienceNews</strong></a>, 
<strong>ClydeBank Media LLC</strong>, and
<strong>Destination DC</strong>.
</p>

<p>We thank authors who support us, and especially note the contribution
of Brandon and Emily Sanderson and their
<a href="https://www.lightweaverfoundation.org/">Lightweaver Foundation</a>
for donating 13 boxes of Brandon Sanderson's books.
</p>


<p>We thank the young people who have supported us,
including those at <a href="https://www.thesienaschool.org/"><strong>the 
Siena School</strong></a>, the <strong>Georgetown Day School
Policy Institute</strong>, and <strong>Teens Leading Change</strong>.</p>

<p>We thank the houses of worship that support us. We especially thank 
<a href="https://stjohnsnorwood.org/"><strong>St. John's 
Norwood</strong></a>, which 
not only collects books for us but also made a 
very generous donation to cover the cost of mailing the books to prisoners.
</p>

<p>We thank the businesses that support us, including <strong>Charles Aris</strong>.

<p>Above all, we thank <a href="https://foundryumc.org/"><strong>Foundry 
United Methodist Church</strong></a> for hosting us. Our
room in Foundry's basement is the heart of our work. It is where we
store almost all of our books and prepare around 160 book packages each week.
Without Foundry, we could not serve nearly as many incarcerated people.
