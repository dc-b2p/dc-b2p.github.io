<p><em>"I would like to know if you could bless me with some books. I 
don't have money. I have two children to support and I lost everything 
because of my trial. I have 18 months left to get out and I want to make 
the most of my time."</em> <span class="signature">&mdash;M.,</span> a mother

<h2>August 5 Fundraiser: Punk Rock Karaoke</h2>

<p>Mailing books to prisoners like M. costs us around $6 per package, so 
we're grateful to local music venue The Black Cat for hosting a 
fundraiser for us! The fundraiser will be a punk rock karaoke night, and 
it will take place at 8pm on Saturday, August 5, 2023. Tickets will cost 
<a href="https://www.blackcatdc.com/shows/punk-rock-karaoke.html">$10 in 
advance</a> or $15 at the door. The Black Cat is located at 1811 14th 
Street NW in Washington DC. If you enjoy punk rock karaoke, please join 
us!</p>

<p><strong>[Probably add the flyer image here, but size is a consideration.
The flyer would need to be big in order for the text to be legible. However,
really big pictures can be annoying to scroll through on a 
phone.]</strong></p>

<h2>Keeping Our Volunteers Safe</h2>

<p>During the early months of the pandemic, when the church that hosts us 
was closed, a core group of volunteers prepared book packages in their 
homes. Thankfully, those days are behind us, and we are once again 
working in the basement of Foundry United Methodist Church.</p>

<p>Because the pandemic is ongoing and we need to protect the health of our 
volunteers, especially those who are medically vulnerable, we have made 
several changes to our pre-pandemic procedures:</p>

<ul>

<li>We limit how many volunteers can be in the room at one time, and
require volunteers to sign up for their hours in advance. (If you
volunteered with us before the pandemic, contact btopdc@gmail.com to
request access to the calendar used for this purpose.)</li>

<li>We require all people working in the room to wear masks.</li>

<li>We run a HEPA air purifier.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have not previously volunteered with us and would like to start, 
contact btopdc@gmail.com and ask to be added to our orientation wait 
list. Those on the wait list will be notified via e-mail when 
orientations are scheduled.</p>

<p><strong>[Should I include the photo of the HEPA filter and masked
volunteer that was previously used on Twitter? It wouldn't add anything
of value, but people often seem to like photos.]</strong></p> 

<h2>Forgotten Treasures</h2>

<p><em>"I want you to keep this letter and read it in times of 
difficulty."</em> This sentence appears near the end of a deeply moving 
letter of love and support. Was it a letter from a volunteer to a 
prisoner? No. Was it a letter from a prisoner to a volunteer? Also no.</p>

<p>The letter was sent to a person who did not, as far as we know, have any 
connection to anyone in prison. The person apparently treasured the 
letter, keeping it flat within the pages of a book. Unfortunately, the 
letter was forgotten when the book was later given away.</p>

<p>We find similar items almost every week. Some appear to have been placed 
in books for safekeeping, while others were clearly being used as 
bookmarks. Items have included a child's artwork, family photos, two 
prescriptions from an otorhinolaryngologist for controlled substances, 
pressed flowers, a tax form (complete with enough information to steal 
the recipient's identity), a lottery ticket, dollar bills, business 
cards, a membership card for a golf club, and airplane boarding passes. 
Recently, a volunteer learned about purchases her spouse had made when 
she discovered three of his credit card receipts in a book!</p>

<p>We check books carefully before sending them, both to protect the 
privacy of book donors and to prevent the incarcerated recipients of 
books from getting in trouble for possessing "contraband". However, we 
are seldom able to reunite the misplaced treasures found within books 
with their rightful owners.</p>

<p>So, if you plan to donate books to us, please flip through them first 
and remove any items you find.</p>

<h2>Avoiding Waste, and Spreading the Joy of Books</h2>

<p>We welcome book donations, and send as many donated books as we can to 
prisoners. However, some donated books cannot be sent to prisoners, for 
a variety of reasons. As an example, some art books and even 
dictionaries are banned in prisons because they contain illustrations of 
the naked human form. Other books would be rejected by prisons because 
of tiny stains or spots of water damage. As much as possible, we avoid 
wasting these books.</p>

<p>Books that are in sellable condition are often sent to 
<a href="https://www.betterworldbooks.com/"> Better World Books</a>, which 
gives us credit that we can use to obtain books we need. Others are 
donated to 
<a href="https://turningthepage.org/get-involved/donate/">Turning the 
Page</a>. Many are placed in Little Free Libraries around the city.</p>

<p>Occasionally, we are able to donate books directly to readers in need. 
One night a volunteer leaving our workspace with a box of books for 
Little Free Libraries encountered an unhoused person who asked whether 
she could have some of the books to read. Naturally, our volunteer 
allowed her to take what she wanted. Another time, two boxes of books 
that couldn't be sent to prisoners were donated to a respite center for 
people who had fled their homes.</p>

<p>Although we are happy to share books with other organizations and 
individuals that can use them, a lot of labor goes into sorting, 
packing, and transporting these books, and this takes us from our 
primary purpose of sending books to prisoners. We therefore request that 
book donors read our 
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/donate-books/">guidance on book 
donations</a> and donate only books that we will be able to send to 
prisoners. We accept book donations on Wednesdays 6-8pm in our room in 
the basement of Foundry United Methodist Church. (Please bring only two 
bags or boxes at a time. For larger donations, contact 
btopdc@gmail.com.)</p>

<h2>Letters from Incarcerated Readers</h2>

<p>"I appreciate all your hard work to promote literacy and the love of 
reading. Reading is at times the only bright spots in my day. I've been 
especially glad to read more black/brown and woman authors recently, as 
well as foreign authors." 
<span class="signature">&mdash;Jason,</span> Kentucky</p>

<p>"I'd like to thank you for what you do for us unfortunate[s]. I am 
currently in super max (AKA the hole) and reading material/education is 
sparse. So having your organization to make my circumstance more 
bearable is a real blessing. Thank you and God bless." 
<span class="signature">&mdash;Bobby,</span> Utah</p>

<p>"I give you thanks for the good labor you're doing sending books to we 
who are prisoners... I received what you sent me which I liked. I spent 
time reading instead of having bad thoughts." 
<span class="signature">&mdash;S.,</span> Texas</p>

<p>"I like to read books and itâ€™s how I do my time. I have no help from 
family, relatives or friends. I am having a hard time doing time. I am 
thankful for places like DC [Books to Prisons] who help people like me 
get some books so thank you all." 
<span class="signature">&mdash;Hector,</span> California</p>

<p>"Another inmate at my facility recently got a shipment from your 
organization, and he was not only grateful for such an amazing service, 
but thrilled with the selections you sent! I in turn asked him for your 
information, so I can make a request as well." 
<span class="signature">&mdash;Richaud,</span> North 
Carolina</p>

<p>"Thank you guys for everything you do. The sheer joy of receiving a 
package from you guys is the closest thing we get to unwrapping a 
present behind bars. These books do not come here to just die. They are 
passed around and enjoyed by so many others before they are eventually 
donated to the unit library. Thank you so much for giving a damn about 
our sanity. I can't tell you how much it is appreciated."
<span class="signature">&mdash;Ronald,</span> 
Texas</p>

<p>"I'm writing to give you thanks for the little books you sent me; they 
are very useful for me and serve as a tool for drawing, which is 
basically what I do here to survive. Thank you!" 
<span class="signature">&mdash;J.,</span> South Carolina</p>

<p><strong>[Note to the newsletter editors: I'm leaning towards deleting all the 
letter quotes beyond this point. There are so MANY of them, and I find 
the sheer length of this section overwhelming. However, if you guys 
especially like any of the ones below, I can keep them, and perhaps 
delete some of the ones above. To me, seven quotes seems like a 
reasonable number.]</strong></p>

<p>"Dear Friends, Thank you so dearly for the kindness & caring which 
honestly is such a blessing, by providing literature for me (and others) 
has granted me the possibility of being much more educated, a feat I 
heretofore thought to remain a vain undertaking. I've come a long way, 
thanks to you!" 
<span class="signature">&mdash;Cory,</span> North Carolina</p>

<p>"It is a blessing to me that goes beyond words! What you are doing for 
those of us who are incarcerated means so much. It is easy to feel 
forgotten when behind these walls... To have such kindness shown from a 
stranger shows how bright each of you... shines." 
<span class="signature">&mdash;Lindsey,</span> Alabama</p>

<p>"Thank you so much for caring enough to help me with books. I hope your 
good deed comes back to you 10 fold."
<span class="signature">&mdash;Larry,</span> North Carolina
</p>

<p>"Thank you for all you do for us. Know that your efforts are making a 
difference in us. Knowledge is the key."
<span class="signature">&mdash;Tommy,</span> Texas</p>

<p>"I want to start out by thanking you for all that you have done in 
helping us prisoners keep our sanity. You and other book places keep us 
mentally stable in a place that is meant to break us. Thank you so 
much." <span class="signature">&mdash;Robert,</span> Mississippi</p>


<h2>Thank You</h2>

<p>We would like to thank everyone who supports our work. A hazard in 
having a thank-you section in a newsletter is that it will, 
inevitably, omit countless names that should be included. So, instead of
even attempting to list everyone we are thankful to, we are going 
to highlight just a handful of donors who are representative of our many 
supporters.</p>

<p>We thank the 
<a href="https://www.dclibraryfriends.org/Join"><strong>Friends 
of the Library groups</strong></a> that donate books to us,
including the Friends groups in Cleveland Park, Mount Pleasant, Georgetown,
Arlington, Centreville, and Great Falls.</p>

<p>We thank the publishers and others who have given us large quantities of 
publications, including 
<a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/"><strong>ScienceNews</strong></a>, 
<strong>ClydeBank Media LLC</strong>,
 and <strong>Destination DC</strong>.
</p>

<p>We thank the young people who have donated books,
including those at <a href="https://www.thesienaschool.org/"><strong>The 
Siena School</strong></a> and <strong>Teens Leading Change</strong>.</p>

<p>We thank houses of worship that support us. We especially thank 
<a href="https://stjohnsnorwood.org/"><strong>St. John's 
Norwood</strong></a>, which 
not only collects books for us but also made a 
very generous donation to cover the cost of mailing the books to prisoners.
</p>

<p>Above all, we thank <a href="https://foundryumc.org/">Foundry 
United Methodist Church</a> for hosting us. Our
room in Foundry's basement is the heart of our work. It is where we
store almost all of our books and prepare around 160 book packages each week.
Foundry is essential to our smooth functioning.
</p>
