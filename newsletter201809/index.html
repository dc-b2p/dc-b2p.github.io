<h2>September 17, 2018: Trivia Night to Benefit DC Books to Prisons</h2>

<p>Article goes here.
</p>

<h2>Prisoner Artwork</h2>

<p><img src="prisoner-alone-in-cell-resized.jpg"><br><br>
<img src="prisoner-with-books-and-claws-resized.jpg"><br><br>

"Even though I just LOVE drawing action and sci-fi and fantasy super hero stuff, I do draw 
these more darker kind of drawings because that's what I feel like the times I'm 
depressed. And I am DEPRESSED here A LOT! I much rather draw happy fun stuff, but I can't 
help but feel trapped a lot of the times. The one I drew of me in my cell alone is how I 
feel some times... like a man trapped in a small box. And I NEVER can leave that box!... 
The larger drawing with me in my cell where I am not alone is how I feel other times, 
just me in my cell with my demons. I heard somewhere that we all have our demons and so 
this is me with mine. There's a bird flying out of my cell and it's supposed to be made 
out of pages from letters and pages from books because they take me out of my prison... I 
don't know if my art makes sense to you, but it makes sense to me. I just thought I'd 
share that with you." </p>

<h2>Generous Donation of How-to-Draw Books</h2>

<p>Details of donation, photo of a few books, and explanation of why books aimed at kids are
so valuable to us. (Naked Baby Jesus!) Don't write article until/unless Doug says okay.
</p>

<p>Other valuable books recently donated. "Going Boldly on Your Inner
Voyage: The Unauthorized Starfleet Manual"
</p>

<h2>Books for Children Visiting Incarcerated Family Members</h2>

<p>Joe, Kim, and Graham met through their work with Reach Incorporated, an organization that
trains teens to teach younger students. As committed supporters and regular volunteers,
these three people came to know each other. And, over time, friendships developed.
</p>

<p>Last year, Reach's founder, Mark, got married. Wanting to make a special gift,
this trio of terrific people began thinking of ways to celebrate Mark's marriage to his
wife, Elizabeth, in a way that was meaningful to all.
</p>

<p>It was at that time that BtP received approval to distribute children's books to visitor
waiting rooms in the federal prison system. Reach had facilitated the creation of
children's books by teens in Washington DC, and all that was needed to distribute those
books to prison waiting rooms was funding. Working with their publishing partners, Shout
Mouse Press, the three friends made a gift to distribute Reach's books.
</p>

<p>In the coming months, five of Reach's books will be distributed to all 120 federal prisons
where DC citizens serve time -- 600 books in total! When children visit incarcerated
family members, they will be able to read books authored by Reach teens. [** Check on verb
tenses, since article was written a while ago. Has the distribution now taken place? **]
</p>

<p>Joe will never meet the kids that read these books. Kim will likely never hear anyone
thank her. Graham won't get to see the young readers enjoying the books. But, all the
same, they chose to be there in a really powerful way for young people visiting
loved ones in federal prisons. And, with their help, Reach and Shout Mouse will be able to
bring comfort at a time when it's needed the most.
